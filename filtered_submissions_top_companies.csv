1654092072,13,"Electric vehicle giant Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) in Austin, Tex., designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems. It was recently removed from the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index. The stock has declined 12.9% in price over the past month and 33.8% over the past six months to close yesterday's trading session at $758.26. In addition, it is currently trading 39% below its 52-week high of $1,243.49, which it hit on Nov. 4, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Wedbush and Daiwa Capital analysts slashed TSLA's price target to $1,000 from $1,400 and to $800 from $1,150, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, its 27.10% trailing-12-month gross profit margin is 24.4% lower than the 35.82% industry average. Furthermore, supply chain challenges, semiconductor chip shortages, COVID-19 outbreaks in China, and high inflation make the stock's near-term prospects uncertain.

&amp;#x200B;

TSLA is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $906.57 and $912.94, respectively, indicating a downtrend. Furthermore, it could keep retreating in the near term due to concerns over increased raw materials costs and stalled factory operations. Also, the stock looks overvalued at the current price level, and I think it could be wise to wait for a better entry point in the stock.

# **Investors set their sights on upcoming inflation report as the bear market rally falters - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/investors-set-their-sights-on-upcoming-inflation-report-as-the-bear-market-rally-falters.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market may try to regain its footing in the next few sessions, even as a fresh inflation report looms large at the end of the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks struggled to move forward in the past week. With Friday’s sell-off, the major indexes closed out the four-day period with losses. That was disappointing to investors looking for a similar upside to the week before Memorial Day during which the S&amp;P 500 gained about 6.5%.
*****
&gt; Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab chief investment strategist, said the market’s late May surge was likely the setup for more selling.
*****
&gt; “The type of rally like we saw last week and some of what it contained looks a little more typical of bear market rallies,” she said. “I still think you’re likely to get countertrend pops in some of the more speculative areas of the market. ... But I think very decidedly the low quality trade is in the rearview mirror. I think to do well in this environment you have to be value minded. Not value indexes, but valuation minded.”
*****
&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 briefly dipped into a bear market on May 20, it has not closed with a 20% decline from its high. However, Sonders said the current situation is the equivalent of a bear market, based on the sharp declines in individual stocks.
*****
&gt; Sonders does not yet see signs that would indicate stocks could turn higher, though she says there is scope for more sharp rallies.
*****
&gt; “I think the sentiment environment is not universally bearish enough yet,” she said. She said sentiment and behavioral measures need to show extremes.
*****
&gt; # Inflation peak?
&gt; In the coming week, the economic calendar is relatively light. Consumer price index and consumer sentiment — both released on Friday — are the most important reports.
*****
&gt; May’s CPI is expected to be just slightly cooler than April, and some economists are expecting it could confirm that inflation has peaked. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said year-over-year headline inflation is expected at 8.2%, just below April’s 8.3% pace.
*****
&gt; “If CPI comes in at or near consensus, I think investors could feel better,” he said. Hogan said the market’s late May breakout helped sentiment, even though stocks backtracked in the past week. “Investors are in a more constructive place, and that can carry through if CPI is anywhere near consensus or better,” he said.
*****
&gt; Headline inflation, including food and energy, was running at 8.5% in March, and the hope is that CPI will ease from here to half that level by year-end, Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said CPI will be affected by the jump in gasoline prices in May. Used car prices and food costs could also be factors, she added.
*****
&gt; “Everyone’s hoping for this peak inflation, but it may be more elusive and less of a peak than people would like it to be,” Swonk said.
*****
&gt; Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday that she does not see enough evidence inflation has peaked, and she is on board with multiple half point rate hikes to combat it. Fed officials are in a quiet period in the coming week, ahead of their meeting June 14.
*****
&gt; Schwab’s Sonders said the market may be concerned in the short term about whether inflation has peaked.
*****
&gt; “But it’s not just whether we’re at the peak. It’s the speed at which we come down off that peak and ultimately to what level,” she said. “Is the [Federal Reserve] on a mission to get inflation down to the 2% target? Or are they going to feel comfortable with a 3% level. ... To me, it’s where does the plane land? Is the runway at a higher elevation than it was pre-pandemic?”
*****
&gt; With the CPI Friday, traders say there is not much for the market to latch onto ahead of that report.
*****
&gt; “You have a whole week of price action, and as of right now, the price action seems ‘glass half empty,’” said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com.
*****
&gt; Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said he is watching to see if the S&amp;P 500 holds support at 4,073 and 4,000 below that. If not, it could drop back to its recent low of 3,810.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed Friday at 4,108, down 1.6% on the day and 1.2% for the week.
*****
&gt; “Traders are losing faith in trying to put more risk on to catch more of an oversold bounce, or a bear market bounce. They’d almost not want to be involved because there’s too many potholes,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.
*****
&gt; Redler said Tesla CEO Elon Musk soured sentiment, after reports that Musk told Tesla executives he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy and needs to cut 10% of Tesla’s workforce. The comments followed closely on a remark from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that he is preparing for an economic hurricane.
*****
&gt; “You can’t have the poster child of risk saying they’re going to reduce their headcount by 10%. If they’re supposed to have a multiple for growth, and they reduce the headcount, then something has to give with valuation,” Redler said. Tesla shares fell 9% Friday.
*****
&gt; # Earnings warnings
&gt; While there are few earnings reports in the coming week, Hogan said companies could follow Microsoft’s lead and issue warnings. Microsoft lowered its guidance on revenues, citing an unfavorable currency impact. Salesforce also lowered revenue guidance due to currency.
*****
&gt; “Investors are at least looking through that. At least, it’s not a demand issue. They’re focusing on the higher dollar and what it might do to multinationals,” he said.
*****
&gt; Campbell Soup and Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel’s, report quarterly results Wednesday. Signet Jewelers and DocuSign post earnings Thursday.
*****
&gt; Sonders said weakening earnings and profit margin outlooks could trigger another leg down for the market.
*****
&gt; “We had the valuation re-rating by virtue of the weakness in the market, but we haven’t yet seen the weakness in forward expectations in earnings,” she said.
*****
&gt; Sonders said the market rallies need to show better breadth, meaning a high percentage of stocks climbing together, before it begins to turn.
*****
&gt; Another sign she is watching is the put/call ratio, which would need to be a higher level to reflect more pessimism. This ratio is used as a contrarian indicator. It is a measure of the number of put to call options. Put options bet that stock prices decline and a high number would suggest very negative sentiment in the market.

&gt; # Will There Be A June Swoon? Maybe, But Maybe Not

&gt; After a late month rally, we can say goodbye to the month of May, which now opens the door to June. Here’s the bad news, June is historically a weak month and it is actually the worst month of the year during a midterm year, down 1.8% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-1-1.png))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news though is the past 10 years, it has been a solid month, up 1.4% on average to rank as the fourth best month. But the past 20 years it has been weak (only September has been worse) and since 1950 only August, February, and September were worse.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-2-1.png))**

&gt; “June has something for everyone, as it is no doubt a very weak month historically, but the past decade it has been strong,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Still, after the big bounce in late May, we wouldn’t be surprised at all if this recent strength continued into a potential summer rally.”

&gt; Here are three reasons for optimism. First, after the huge gains last week, the 7 week losing streak for the S&amp;P 500 Index is finally over. There had been only three prior 7 week losing streaks and twice (1970 and 1980) saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 33% a year later. On the other side though, the returns in 2001 weren’t very good as 9/11 and the recession hurt returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-3-5.31.22.png))**

&gt; Second, the S&amp;P 500 corrected 18.7% before the rally last week, which could be a good thing as looking at previous corrections between 10-20% showed gains of nearly 25% on average a year later and nearly 40% two years later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-4-5.31.22.png))**

&gt; Lastly, huge gains like the 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 last week are usually a great sign for the bulls. Here are all the times it has gained more than 6% in a week (since 1950) and the future returns are very strong. Up 12.5% on average six months later and nearly 22% a year later on average is something that could have most bulls smiling after the rough start to 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-5-5.31.22.png))**

&gt; 2022 has been a rough year for most investors, but we do see better times ahead. Last week’s bottom and rally could be the start of brighter skies ahead for investors.

&gt; # Biggest Energy Names See Record Moves

&gt; The Energy sector has been on an absolute tear over the pandemic period with a 273% gain since the pandemic lows in March 2020. During the overall market downturn of the past several months, it is the only cyclical sector to have managed to retain its uptrend as it has rallied over 60% year to date compared to a 13% decline for the S&amp;P 500. Taking a look through our Chart Scanner tool, there is not too much variation in the charts of large-cap Energy stocks with strong uptrends across the board and many new multi-year highs as a result. Taking a look at two of the largest members who account for nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars in market cap, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are good examples. CVX has reached new all-time highs following its meteoric rise over the past couple of years while XOM has recovered most of the past decade's declines. Additionally, we would note that XOM has historically tended to be much larger than CVX, but the pandemic and the subsequent rally over the past couple of years have brought the two stocks' market caps much more closely in line with one another.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/053122-CVX-XOM-1a.png))**

&gt; Both long-standing staples of the Energy sector, XOM and CVX are also notable in that they are both dividend aristocrats (a group of stocks that have now raised their dividend annually for 25 or more consecutive years). That means on top of massive capital gains, investors have also been rewarded handsomely with dividends. Even after these massive rallies, CVX still yields 3.25% and XOM pays an even better 3.67%. Taking this into account, the two-year runs including dividends that these stocks have been on are unlike anything observed since at least the early 1980s. Given the record two-year run we've seen in the Energy space, it's tough to get super bullish on this area of the market now. Remember, we saw an explosive move higher like this for other areas of the market earlier on in the post-pandemic era (think meme stocks, SPACs, high growth, etc.), but once the tide turned in late 2021, the downside reversal was just as extreme. Energy stocks have completely different fundamental risk profiles than aggressively valued Tech stocks, and ultimately their performance is mostly tied to the price of oil. That being said, investor psychology and herd mentality work the same regardless of the asset class.

&gt; # Sentiment Swings Back to Optimism

&gt; Sentiment has taken a big swing higher across surveys this week as the S&amp;P 500 has experienced some upside mean reversion. The weekly AAII sentiment survey has seen bullish sentiment rebound from a sub-20% reading all the way back up to 32%. Relative to the historical average of 37.84%, that reading continues to show a depressed level of optimism for individual investors, but it is the strongest reading since the week of March 24th. As for the 12.2 percentage point jump in bullish sentiment week over week, it was the largest one week gain since the week of October 14th of last year when it rose 12.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; As bullish sentiment surged, there was a massive 16.4 percentage point drop in bearish sentiment. That was the largest one week decline in the reading on pessimism since July 15, 2010 when it fell 19.27 percentage points. Now at 37.1%, bearish sentiment is at the lowest level since the end of March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Such a large decline in bearish sentiment in only one week has pretty much been unheard of in the post Financial Crisis years. Again, July 2010 was the last time bears fell by at least 15 percentage points and before that there are only about two dozen other occurrences without another instance in the previous three months. While it was a big decline, bearish sentiment remains fairly elevated at 37.1%, but that is inline with most other occurrences since the mid 2000s whereas bearish sentiment was generally lower from the occurrences before 2005.

&gt; As for how the S&amp;P 500 has tended to do following these massive bearish sentiment shifts, the S&amp;P 500 has generally tended to move higher with outperformance versus the norm on a median basis one week and one month out. Although again performance is consistently positive, the size of gains have tended to be below or more inline with the norm three, six, and twelve months out from these occurrences.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bear-Drop.png))**

&gt; After the large moves in bulls and bears this week, sentiment continues to favor pessimism but to a much smaller degree than recent weeks as the bull bear spread narrowed to -5.1 points.

&gt; # Was that the Low?

&gt; Stocks rallied hard last week, as the S&amp;P 500 Index broke a seven week losing streak in resounding fashion; its 6.6% gain was the best since November 2020. That strong response from equities, following one of the worst starts to the year ever, has many investors questioning, “Was that the low?” While we are certainly open to that possibility, today we will take a look at why the technical picture suggests volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term.

&gt; First, let’s take a look at the technical set-up of the S&amp;P 500. While stocks have bounced decisively off important support near 3800, the index is now faced with multiple levels of technical resistance, including broken support from the February and March lows, and the 50-day moving average at 4270. Given stocks steady series of lower highs and lower lows throughout 2022, it is important for us to see evidence that this trend has turned and can hold a higher high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blog-6.2.22.png))**

&gt; Second, we remain skeptical that this market has truly bottomed without the capitulatory flush usually found at major market lows, as we discussed in last month’s Weekly Market Commentary. Nothing in markets has to happen, but whether it is put/call ratios, a stubbornly low VIX (a measure of implied market volatility based on options prices), or even just the fact that several of the nongrowth sectors arguably remain rangebound from 2021 and haven’t corrected, it would be highly unusual for us to see such a major market low without genuine signs of investor panic and indiscriminate selling. Of the five major signs of panic that we track and are often found at major market bottoms, only one has triggered so far this year in contrast to a minimum of 3 that have been found at recent lows in March 2020, the fall of 2015, late 2011 and the Great Financial Crisis in 2008-2009.

&gt; Finally, while we are inching closer, we remain in the seasonally weak part of the year and a May low would still be on the early side of the average low in a midterm year. Looking at all the midterm years going back to 1950, only two have seen their yearly low before May 19, when the S&amp;P 500 made its closing low two weeks ago. We would note though, that the depth of this correction is almost exactly in line with the average mid-term year pullback. And regardless of when we make that bottom, as the chart below shows, the gains a year after the low have been substantial with a more than 30% average return and only one occurrence falling short of a double digit gain.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chart-6.2.22.png))**

&gt; “We are anything but market pessimists,” explained LPL Financial Technical Market Strategist Scott Brown. “In fact, we believe there will be substantial opportunity in stocks on the other side of this volatility and likely in the second half of the year. However, outside of this recent rally, very little about this market has changed from a technical standpoint and that makes us wary of calling the all-clear. We believe a slight lean towards defensive sectors and away from the growth-oriented areas of this market still make sense”.

&gt; LPL Research’s Strategic and Tactical Asset Allocation Committee is most positive on healthcare and real estate and is becoming increasingly positive on energy. Within growth sectors, we are most negative on communication services and consumer discretionary and also believe the industrials sector is likely to underperform.

&gt; # Revisiting The 50/50 Club

&gt; Amidst all of the craziness in growth/meme stocks in early 2021, we took a look at the Russell 3000 stocks that were both 50%+ off their 52 week highs and still 50%+ above their 52 week lows to show some of the most volatile names in the market last May. Today, we are revisiting that club to show some of the growth names that have gotten hammered since last May but have recovered substantially off of their lows recently. Much of this craziness is resembled through Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation Fund (ARKK), which is now about 20% above its lows on 5/11 but still 67% off its 52 week high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/ARKK-Performance-Chart-060322-2.png))**

&gt; Currently, there are 33 Russell 3,000 stocks with a market cap of at least $1 billion that are 50%+ below their 52 week highs and 50%+ above their 52 week lows. These 33 stocks are outlined below, and every single one of them are still below their 200-day moving averages. However, only 12 are below their 50-DMAs. The average stock on this list is 67.3% off its 52 week highs (median: 65.4%) and 68.9% above its 52 week low (median: 60.6%).

&gt; There are a few notable names on this list, including the new-to-market EV manufacturer Rivian (RIVN), the famed meme stock GameStop (GME), the Metaverse Index component Unity Software (U), the digital platform engineering company EPAM Software (EPAM), and the EV charging station company ChargePoint (CHPT). CHPT is up 63% from its lows on May 11th. EPAM has already doubled since its lows in March. While it may not seem like much if you own the shares a lot higher, these names have recently seen massive bounces off of their lows.

&gt; # Lackluster June Recent 21-Year Seasonal Chart

&gt; June recorded average losses for DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 the last 21 years. NASDAQ and Russell 2K have fared better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. Then stocks drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon the index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small caps.

&gt; # June Worst Month of Midterm Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5245cc76a9f0c7b4d3069ea52fe049c9/3798b9cf894501aa-be/s500x750/d8c5f1f6b0aca5ac339fb5698c881480d26f8e90.jpg))**

&gt; Over the last 51 years June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks as a rule ranking fifth best with a 1.0% average gain, up 29 of 51 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.9% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In midterm years since 1950, June ranks no better than eleventh. June is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 month in midterm years. Average losses range from 1.5% by Russell 1000 to 1.8% from S&amp;P 500. Of the five indexes, none has a winning track record in June. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined more than they have risen.

Tesla, Netflix, Meta look to trim costs as sentiment shifts

Inflation, war, pandemic among forces weighing on industry

From Seattle to Silicon Valley to Austin, a grim new reality is setting in across the tech landscape: a heady, decades-long era of rapid sales gains, boundless jobs growth and ever-soaring stock prices is coming to an end.

What’s emerging in its place is an age of diminished expectations marked by job cuts and hiring slowdowns, slashed growth projections and shelved expansion plans. The malaise is damaging employee morale, affecting the industry’s ability to attract talent, and has wide-ranging implications for US economic growth and innovation.

Illustrations of a dour new business climate surface daily against the backdrop of a prolonged economic slowdown, a grinding war in Europe, rising interest rates and inflation, and a global pandemic dragging into its third year. In the past two weeks, a parade of big names joined the crowd. Social media app Snap Inc. on May 23 pruned sales and profit forecasts and said it will slow hiring. The next day, Lyft Inc. said it will bring on fewer people and look for other cost cuts. Days later, Microsoft Corp. tapped the brakes on hiring in several key divisions, and Instacart Inc. said it will dial back hiring plans to nip costs ahead of a planned initial public offering.

The drumbeat continued yesterday, as Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told employees the electric-vehicle maker needs to reduce its salaried workforce by 10% and pause hiring worldwide. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. also said  it will extend a hiring freeze and rescind a number of accepted job offers, citing market conditions.

Similarly gloomy pronouncements had already been dribbling out for weeks. Amazon.com Inc. has too many workers and too much warehouse space, and its business is hurting from rapidly rising inflation costs. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is easing hiring and paring expenses, and Twitter Inc. instituted a hiring freeze and withdrew some job offers ahead of a planned takeover by Musk. Apple Inc. warned in April that restrictions related to Covid-19 lockdowns in China will shave as much as $8 billion from revenue in the current quarter.

The humbled corporate ambitions signify a vibe shift for an industry that had seemed invulnerable, once offering workers and investors protection from the instability of the larger economy.

“They are no longer sure bets,” said Tom Forte, a tech analyst at D.A. Davidson, of the technology industry’s behemoths. “They aren’t sure bets because there are a number of fundamental things working against them.”

The Nasdaq Composite Index has lost a quarter of its value since Nov. 19, when it reached an all-time high. That’s even taking into account the index’s 5.8% rebound in the past two weeks.

The specter of job cuts has begun to haunt the Silicon Valley psyche. On Blind, an app that employees can use to talk anonymously about their employers, discussions about hiring freezes increased by 13 times from April 19 to May 19 compared with a year earlier. Layoff discussions increased by five times, and talk about a recession is up by 50 times.

Unfounded speculation that Meta was gearing up for a round of firings ripped through social media in May, resulting in the creation of the hashtag #metalayoff, which began trending on LinkedIn. Dozens of recruiters and employers began using the hashtag to offer alternative job openings. A Meta spokesperson says the company has no current plans for staff reductions.

Still, what was once an engine of growth for the US economy has sputtered of late. More than 126,000 tech workers have lost their jobs since the beginning of the pandemic, according to Layoffs.fyi. Netflix Inc. said last month it’s laying off about 150 workers after reporting an unexpected subscriber loss; the streaming giant’s shares have tumbled 71% since mid-November. At Meta, managers are slowing hiring for many mid-to-senior level positions companywide, and in April cut back on adding engineers with limited experience.

Twitter employees, meanwhile, are bracing for potential layoffs as the company awaits the arrival of new owner Musk, whose pitch to bankers included cost cuts. CEO Parag Agrawal jumped ahead in early May, sending Twitter’s 7,500-plus employees a note explaining the social network would start with reductions in travel, marketing and event costs, with leaders told to “manage tightly to your budgets, prioritizing what matters most.”

Likewise Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi said in a memo to staff that the ride-hailing giant would “treat hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount.” The sentiment is taking a toll on morale internally, said an Uber employee who asked not to be identified.

The shock is probably the biggest at companies like Meta, Twitter and Uber, which were still in relative infancy the last time the tech industry was hit, during the financial crisis in 2008. Things were worse still when the dot-com bubble burst at the turn of the century. The difference this time is that the pandemic reinforced how important and necessary many of these tech products are, giving them some cushion against the initial economic ravages of the Covid-19 shutdowns.

“Everybody discovered that tech was not only nice, it was indispensable,” said Russell Hancock, CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a nonprofit that studies Silicon Valley and its economy. What’s happening now appears to be a market correction, Hancock added, though he also worries that some of the shine and innovation of the tech industry is going away as products like streaming services and social networking become more of a utility.

It’s possible “we’ll start to think about [tech] sort of like the gas lines going into our homes, or electricity,” he said. “That’s kind of a new thing for Silicon Valley. It’s sort of a Detroit kind of existence where cars just became the backdrop, the furniture of the region.”

Tesla’s employee headcount will rise over the next year, Elon Musk said Saturday — despite an earlier report that he planned to make cuts at his company over concerns about the economy.

“Total headcount will increase, but salaried [sic] should be fairly flat,” Musk tweeted in response to a Twitter account predicting Tesla’s staff would rise over the next 12 months

The multibillionaire’s tweet came two days after he told Tesla employees in an email that he has a “super bad feeling” about the state of the US economy, and needed to lay off around 10% of the electric car maker’s workforce, Reuters reported Friday.

Tesla reps could not immediately be reached for comment.

The company employs nearly 100,000.

1654397245,459,"'Bill Gates earned the displeasure of Tesla, Inc. chief executive officer Elon Musk by taking a short position against the EV maker.

A chat between the two that was leaked on Twitter in April showed Musk refusing to work with Gates on philanthropy or climate change initiatives, as Gates was trying to profit from a fall in Tesla stock. The Tesla CEO also said this is contradictory to Gates' desire to fight climate change and that he should be supporting Tesla's electric vehicle development.

In an interview with a French YouTube channel ""Hugo Decrypte"" that was aired on Thursday, Gates was asked if Musk is right in taking such a stance.

Gates responded by saying. Tesla isn't short of capital, and the company has done a ""fantastic job."" He also said the company's cars are great.

The Microsoft Corporation founder noted that he gives a lot more money to efforts addressing climate change than Musk or anyone else for that matter.

Gates pointed out that cars account for only 16% of emissions, and the other 84% also needs to be solved. Although he acknowledged that Musk has ""done a great job."" 

""Somebody shorting his stock doesn't slow him down or hurt him in any way,"" Gates added.

As recently as late last month, Musk in a Twitter chat with his followers said Gates' Tesla short bet may have ballooned, and the latter would need about $1.5 billion to $2 billion to cover the short position.'

1654480096,740,"This is anecdotal. I’m stupid so take it with a grain of salt.

I work in IT in public education. Hence I’m stupid and can’t do anything else more promising in tech. 

Think about your first interactions with a computer. Word processing maybe? Kids are not using Word these days, like at all. Maybe you first word processed with Word. Maybe you grew up with Office products. This generation isn’t. 

Edit: They’re not using PowerPoint, they’re using Slides. They’re not using Excel, they’re using Sheets. They’re not using Outlook, they’re using Gmail. They’re not using Microsoft Teams, they’re using Zoom, and then in 2nd for video conferencing they’re using Google Meet. Office isn’t necessarily Microsoft’s primary business, but the battle between Microsoft and Google is a battle for mass adoption. And Google right now is planting seeds to have an iron grip on Gen Z when they enter the private sector later on. Microsoft will have to fight to hold market share and I reckon they’ll lose vs Google long term. The game is a fight for mass adoption, and there’s numerous ways to monetize mass adoption. Want a cheap Windows computer that’s sub $300? They absolutely suck, they’re terrible. Want a Chromebook that’s sub $300? They’re decent, snappy useable machines. Look to the developing world. As network infrastructure improves, cheap web based Chromebooks will continue to be a hit among low income consumers in developing nations. Who’s better positioned to scale as the world gets more and more connected? My vote is for Google. Market share of Chrome OS has skyrocketed the last couple of years: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/the-worlds-second-most-popular-desktop-operating-system-isnt-macos-anymore/?amp=1

Google is the most evil company in the world. And as the evil geniuses they are, they’re thinking decades ahead. They know that their long term future depends on kids getting hooked on their products, so that when they’re leaders of companies in the future, their company is powered by Google Workspace and not Office. Google beat Microsoft and Apple in the education market. ChromeOS now has more market share than MacOS. Kids are doing all of their productivity tasks in the Google ecosystem. Remember back in 2016/17 when you might have said to yourself, “why do all these kids want to be Youtubers when they grow up?” I know why this happened. I’ve seen the district dashboard data. YouTube is the #1 site kids use on their school issued Chromebook.

Edit: You might say to yourself, Apple won the education market in the 80s/90s, but the enterprise market is still driven by Microsoft. Back then there were like 10 Macs in a lab for 500 kids to share. What Google has accomplished is way more impactful. Literally every kid 1 to 1 in public schools now has a Chromebook in their backpack. This is much more groundbreaking than what Apple did and will help Google retain a generation’s worth of customers as they age into adulthood.

1654541158,101," Welcome to my latest Ted talk!

It seems with the latest high profile stock split ($AMZN 20-1 split), there are a lot of misconceptions being thrown around. The majority of this post was first written back when $AAPL had their 4-1 split in August of 2020. Much of the information is relevant to this day and will hopefully clear up common misconceptions around stocks splits. 

First off, ***what happens when a company splits their stock?***

In the case of $AMZN, the stock is splitting 20-1. Today, Jun 6, the shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis. Pre-split, the per-price share was roughly $2,450, today, after accounting for the 20-1 split, each share opened for trading at roughly $122. The number of shares in circulation as a result increased by 20x. **This means the companies valuation has not changed.**

***What about my options contract?***

The vast majority of time with a conventional split like what we have sees with $AMZN, options contracts will be adjusted similar to conventional stock ownership. If you own 1 2500c contract, post-split you’ll own 20 125c options. While I don’t expect this outcome, it is also possible for a non-standard options contract instead. Non-standard contracts are common with reverse splits, not very common with this sort of split.

***What about dividends?***

While not applicable to $AMZN, the dividend yield is expressed as a percentage. 1% (rounding up) will be same regardless if you own 1 share at $400 or 4 shares at $100.

***Should you buy before the stock split or after?***

While a stock may see increased volatility post-split, investing in a company should be done when you as the investor feel the stock is undervalued. This may be pre-split or post-split based on price action. If you are actively trading you may be able to take a speculative position pre-split with the assumption that post-split there will be increased interest in the stock and thus an increase in share price. There is no guarantee we’ll experience a post-split rally though.

**Bottom Line**

Fundamentally nothing changes with a stock pick. When companies execute stock splits they’re simply reducing the cost and thus the barrier to entry for small time investors.

1654548304,38,"I’m sure many of has seen this article on the front page today. As the title suggests, I’m wondering if this changes, in your personal opinion, the likeliness of Musk acquiring Twitter.

Article for reference:

&gt; Elon Musk has a ""right not to consummate"" his acquisition of Twitter and a ""right to terminate the merger agreement,"" according to a letter from his lawyers to the Twitter general counsel Vijaya Gadde sent Monday morning.

&gt; Why it matters: While Musk has been tweeting about the deal being ""on hold"" for a while, this is his first formal, legal suggestion that his agreement to buy Twitter is anything other than legally watertight.

&gt; Between the lines: The letter from Musk is ostensibly about a dispute over data. Musk wants Twitter to provide him with information that will help him ""facilitate his evaluation of spam and fake accounts on the company's platform.""

&gt; The big picture: Thanks to the recent rout in technology shares, both Twitter and Tesla, which is the main source of Musk's wealth, are worth much less today than they were when Musk entered his initial bid of $54.20 per share. That means Musk is overpaying for the company, with money he is going to have difficulty finding.

&gt; What they're saying: ""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,"" the company said in a statement.

&gt; ""We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all shareholders,"" it added. ""We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms.""

&gt; The bottom line: There is zero chance that Twitter will simply accept Musk's assertion that he has the right to withdraw from the agreement. If he tries to do so, things are likely to get messy.

Source: https://www.axios.com/2022/06/06/elon-musk-twitter

I know I have seen many posts on this board stating TWTR is a safe buy because Musk would face potentially huge lawsuits if he backed out. As it would be potentially way more than 1bn if Musk backed out.

&gt; The deal agreement not only includes a $1bn break fee if Musk does quit, but Twitter can also enact a clause that could force Musk to complete the deal at $54.20 a share. Section 9.9 of the agreement entitles Twitter to “specific performance”, whereby Musk has to pay up if he still has the debt-financing in place and Twitter still wants to close the deal. Twitter is in control here, Quinn said. “The remedy – a termination fee or specific performance is at the election of the company, not Musk,” he said.

&gt; Vanderbilt’s Ricks adds: “If Musk isn’t willing to close at $54.20 and if the parties can’t reach a revised deal or settlement, Twitter will very likely sue for specific performance.”Twitter, for its part, remains committed despite Musk’s behaviour. In a statement on Tuesday it said: “Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.”

For those who believed this deal will happen no matter what, does this change anything for you? Or are you still acquiring more shares?

1654627445,401,"Apple plans to expand its fintech offerings when it launches the new iPhone software, iOS 16, this fall.

The company announced new features for the wallet app such as a buy now, pay later service at its annual developers conference Monday.

The new features are designed to attract more people to Apple Pay and keep customers locked into the iOS ecosystem.

Apple is turning into a fintech company.

The company announced several new features for the iPhone’s Wallet app at its developers conference Monday that directly compete with products from other fintech companies such as Affirm and PayPal. The big one: a buy now, pay later service called Apple Pay Later. That announcement sent Affirm shares down more than 5% Monday, and they were down an additional 4% as of Tuesday morning.

Apple will also launch a new payments system later this month that lets you pay someone by tapping your iPhone against theirs. It’s a direct competitor to Block’s Square. And Wallet in iOS 16 will let you track online orders you buy through Apple Pay.

All of this points to one of the most interesting corners of the Apple ecosystem — a growing suite of financial products within the Wallet app. Many of these features aren’t designed to make money for Apple directly, but they do make Apple Pay more attractive for people who haven’t tried it yet. (Apple takes a tiny percentage of every Apple Pay transaction, so the more people using it, the better it is for Apple.) Like most major new iOS features, it’s also another mechanism to keep customers locked into Apple’s ecosystem and upgrading to a new iPhone when they’re ready.

But Apple’s new Wallet features are also coming at a time of great economic uncertainty. Inflation is still going wild. Gas prices continue to hit record highs. And there are plenty of very real fears about an upcoming recession. It could be a tough time for Apple to launch a new product designed to get people to buy more stuff if those trends persist throughout the year.

Apple’s new rivals in the buy now, pay later space have struggled in recent months as consumer spending shifts from goods to services. Other fintech and crypto companies such as Robinhood, PayPal and Coinbase have struggled this year as well.

Apple has a longer-term vision for Wallet. As the company revealed the latest features Monday, executives said the ultimate goal is for the digital Wallet app to replace everything in your physical wallet

But things are moving slowly in some areas, such as last year’s feature that lets you add your driver’s license, which is available in just a couple of states in the U.S., and with a few more expected soon. Even then, you can use the ID only at TSA checkpoints at one airport in Phoenix. Carmakers have also been slow to adopt the iOS feature that lets you store a digital version of your car key on your phone.

Still, Apple told me yesterday there’s little concern over that slow adoption. The hope is consumer demand pushes third parties to adopt the technology.

On the fintech side, however, Apple is building a foundation to provide a boost to its payments business by layering more functions into Apply Pay and Wallet beyond just using your iPhone, instead of your credit card, to pay for things. And because of Apple’s scale with more than a billion devices in use, a lot more people are about to be exposed to these products.

Amazon had negative FCF in 2021. This is an outlier as well. It’s not a trend and is wrecking havoc on my excel sheet.

This is causing the DCF to increase the negative number 10 yrs out. If I change it to positive, it seems too low. On the other hand I’m worried if I ignore last year and value it out from 2020 that I’m missing out on an important lesson for future valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Apple announced the new lending service at its developer conference (WWDC) on Monday, and the company will compete with similar services offered by Affirm ([AFRM.US](https://AFRM.US)) and PayPal ([PYPL.US](https://PYPL.US)), whose shares fell 5.5 percent by the end of the day after Apple's WWDC announcement of its Apple Pay Later product.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Later this year, when Apple releases its new iOS 16 iPhone software, users will be able to use Apple Pay to purchase products and pay their balances in four equal installments over a period of up to six weeks through the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service.

&amp;#x200B;

　　It is understood that Apple has entered into a partnership with MasterCard ([MA.US](https://MA.US)), which interacts with suppliers to offer Apple's upcoming Installments white label BNPL products. Apple says Goldman Sachs ([GS.US](https://GS.US)), the issuer of the Apple Credit Card (Apple Card), is also the technical issuer of these loans and is an official sponsor of BIN, but Apple says it is not using Goldman Sachs' credit decision system or its balance sheet to issue loans this time.

&amp;#x200B;

1654783550,201,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/09/microsoft-is-bringing-xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-to-smart-tvs.html

Microsoft is releasing an Xbox app for smart TVs, enabling consumers to stream Xbox video games even if they don’t own consoles. Microsoft said Thursday that it will first bring the app to Samsung’s 2022 smart TVs and then expand distribution to other manufacturers. It’s a bold bet for Microsoft, after Xbox’s hardware revenue jumped 92% last year. The company said the app will be available starting June 30, in 27 countries. The move indicates Microsoft is focused on picking up revenue from gaming content and services, as opposed to just consoles, where the company is lagging behind Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft’s biggest splash in gaming came earlier this year, when the company announced plans to buy game publisher Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. Gaming is Microsoft’s fourth-largest major product category, and the company is aiming to lure more users to its Game Pass subscription service, which costs $10 a month and includes an option for people playing on PCs and streaming via the cloud. The hardware business picked up steam in 2020 after Microsoft released its Xbox Series X and S consoles, and as people spent more time playing games while offices and schools were closed due to the Covid pandemic. 

But component supply shortages and more recently lockdowns in China have hurt Microsoft’s ability to produce new consoles. “We have taken share globally for two quarters in a row, and we are the market leader this quarter among next-gen consoles in the United States, Canada, U.K. and Western Europe,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on a conference call in April. But the overall picture isn’t so rosy. London-based researcher Ampere Analysis estimated that Microsoft sold 7.7 million Xbox Series S and X consoles in 2021, while Sony sold 12.5 million PlayStation 5 systems and Nintendo sold 24.3 million Switches. Gamers will be able to play the Xbox app with Sony’s Bluetooth-connected DualSense controllers as well as Microsoft’s wireless Xbox controllers. In opening up gaming off the console, Microsoft is going where gamers are playing. That means catering to mobile devices running operating systems from Apple or Google.

Over 25 million Game Pass subscribers can stream games from Microsoft’s data centers onto those devices. A year ago Microsoft said the Xbox division was developing streaming devices for cloud gaming. The company won’t be requiring gamers to connect special devices to Samsung televisions to stream games through the Xbox app. “We have made the decision to pivot away from the current iteration” of a streaming device codenamed Keystone, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. “We will take our learnings and refocus our efforts on a new approach that will allow us to deliver Xbox Cloud Gaming to more players around the world in the future.” Samsung leads the smart TV market with 21.3% share, according to data from Informa Tech’s technology research subsidiary Omdia.","microsoft releasing xbox app smart tvs, enabling consumers stream xbox video games even don’t consoles. microsoft said thursday first bring app samsung’s 2022 smart tvs expand distribution manufacturers. it’s bold bet microsoft, xbox’s hardware revenue jumped 92% last year. company said app available starting june 30, 27 countries. move indicates microsoft focused picking revenue gaming content services, opposed consoles, company lagging behind nintendo sony. microsoft’s biggest splash gaming came earlier year, company announced plans buy game publisher activision blizzard $68.7 billion. gaming microsoft’s fourth-largest major product category, company aiming lure users game pass subscription service, costs $10 month includes option people playing pcs streaming via cloud. hardware business picked steam 2020 microsoft released xbox series x consoles, people spent time playing games offices schools closed due covid pandemic. component supply shortages recently lockdowns china hurt microsoft’s ability produce new consoles. “we taken share globally two quarters row, market leader quarter among next-gen consoles united states, canada, u.k. western europe,” microsoft ceo satya nadella told analysts conference call april. overall picture isn’t rosy. london-based researcher ampere analysis estimated microsoft sold 7.7 million xbox series x consoles 2021, sony sold 12.5 million playstation 5 systems nintendo sold 24.3 million switches. gamers able play xbox app sony’s bluetooth-connected dualsense controllers well microsoft’s wireless xbox controllers. opening gaming console, microsoft going gamers playing. means catering mobile devices running operating systems apple google. 25 million game pass subscribers stream games microsoft’s data centers onto devices. year ago microsoft said xbox division developing streaming devices cloud gaming. company won’t requiring gamers connect special devices samsung televisions stream games xbox app. “we made decision pivot away current iteration” streaming device codenamed keystone, microsoft spokesperson told cnbc email. “we take learnings refocus efforts new approach allow us deliver xbox cloud gaming players around world future.” samsung leads smart tv market 21.3% share, according data informa tech’s technology research subsidiary omdia.","['Sony', 'Blackstone', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/09/microsoft-is-bringing-xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-to-smart-tvs.html', 'Samsung', 'Intel', 'Xbox', 'Omdia', 'Informa Tech’s', 'CNBC', 'Apple', 'DualSense', 'Microsoft']"

1654839341,20,"Shares in video conferencing mainstay Zoom Communications could surge more than tenfold in price over the next four years as skilled employees working from home successfully resist management efforts to herd them back into the office.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest published on Wednesday its thesis for Zoom, the top holding in its flagship Innovation exchange-traded fund (ETF), complete with a $1,500 price target for 2026 and a minimum of $700 should its bearish scenario unfold. 

“We believe current pivots back to in-office mandates could be part of a trial-and-error process for employees that will increase the percent of workers in hybrid/remote working models during the next five years,” ARK wrote. 

Interestingly, the sentiment expressed effectively repudiates the management style of another major conviction call in ARK’s portfolio: electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla. 

Critics including corporate executives have called CEO Elon Musk’s demands for workers to return to their desks for a minimum 40 hours a week with virtually no exception “tone-deaf” in the current environment.

ARK Invest instead seems to share the views of Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who described his $28 billion acquisition of Slack last month as a bet that remote work is not going anywhere.

“Knowledge worker backlash and talent shortages will compel employers to adopt more flexible arrangements,” ARK Invest argued. “Slack reports that employees forced to return to the office full-time experienced the steepest declines in work-life balance and overall satisfaction compared to their hybrid/remote peers, suggesting that in-office mandates will lead to high rates of attrition.”

ARK said it expects the total number of addressable knowledge workers excluding China to hit 832 million in 2026, of which 75% will engage in some form of flexible labor arrangement, up from 489 million and 51% last year.

Under its bull case, Wood’s money management firm even foresaw the share rising to $2,000 over the same period, compared to the $115.46 closing price from Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

What does Musk want to do?

&amp;#x200B;

It has been nearly a month since Musk first raised the issue of Twitter's fake account, to the constant threat to shelve the $44 billion acquisition on the grounds of ""providing relevant data"" to Twitter's final compromise.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding Musk's $44 billion offer, Professor Nelson said it was a bit difficult to understand. He told the ""Daily Economic News"" reporter, ""Firehose's data can already be used commercially. I don't know how much Firehose is priced at. Some websites said It’s $2,500/month. But no matter what the actual cost is, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the $44 billion offer,” he told reporters.

1654887682,350,"Business Insider cited three unnamed sources at the company as saying that it paused its TV advertising. That follows a report by Variety saying that Microsoft will sit out TV upfronts, the opportunity to buy network inventory in advance. When reached for comment, Microsoft said in an emailed statement to Barron’s that it had “nothing additional to share here.”

One person with direct knowledge said the company made the advertising cuts in the face of rising interest rates and supply chain challenges to avoid layoffs, according to the Business Insider report. The company allegedly told media buyers and TV networks that it would not participate in the TV upfronts, which is a period of time where television networks and advertisers negotiate marketing and ad deals, according to Variety. Microsoft spent an estimated $294.8 million on TV advertising in 2021. Other global advertisements for Microsoft companies like Xbox will still be handled by marketing company IPG ’s McCann Worldgroup, according to sources cited by Business Insider.

Microsoft is one of the latest tech giants to slow down hiring in 2022 due to economic uncertainty. The hiring slow down will specifically affect the Windows, Office, and Teams chat and conferencing software groups, according to a Bloomberg report. The company also reduced its financial forecasts for the June quarter earlier this month.

They're an awesome company, their future growth story is amazing, their historical growth and returns are aw-inspiring, but these levels to me personally show that... retail has not pulled their money yet. I don't have data on who/what is propping Tesla up price wise, but I think it's fair to say it's very close to GME/AMC memestock levels valuation wise. However, institutional ownership is about 42% (if that report is accurate/means anything) but I'm sure a portion of that is because it's in a lot of S&amp;P500 ETFs).

I don't know. I believe they deserve to be ""shaken out"" (punished) for gambling, hoping an asset like Bitcoin makes them money despite not bringing any real value to the world (arguably, being a mild contributor to climate change due to all of the computational power used). Is crypto really a net positive on society right now? has it been past 12-36 months? If not, why is it worth $30k? It shouldn't be.

However, how is TA relative for indices ? it doesn't make sense, why would the 21 days moving average on the NASDAQ index chart matter at all? 

Do investors start buying in stocks included in an index when that index chart somehow gives a buying signal? and suddenly everyone starts buying in all of these stocks which drives the index up again ? How important is say a support level on an index exactly ?

1655171499,20,"Elon Musk said in an internal memo that Tesla is going through a ""very tough quarter"" as it struggles with supply chain bottlenecks.

&amp;#x200B;

In an email to employees, the founder and CEO of the electric car leader implored them to help get the company back on track, saying, ""This has been a very tough quarter due to supply chain and production challenges, so it's even more important that we work hard to get back to production!""

&amp;#x200B;

In one of the letters, he said, ""We actually make great, real products that people love and make life and the world a better place.""

&amp;#x200B;

He also stressed to his employees, ""No matter what is going on in this messed up world, what you are doing is pure goodwill, and I have much more respect and admiration for you than I do for the richest guys on Wall Street.""

&amp;#x200B;

Musk also wrote in another letter that the plant in Austin, Texas, is increasing production, the Berlin plant also produced nearly 1,000 cars last week, and its Fremont, California, plant is producing a record number of cars in a single day.

&amp;#x200B;

Not forgetting to swing the axe on layoffs

&amp;#x200B;

Musk often encourages employees to ""sprint"" on the production line near the end of the quarter, but these internal memos are getting more attention than usual given some of the comments he made not long ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, Musk said in an email titled ""Global Hiring Pause"": ""I have a very bad feeling about the economy."" He also said that due to the current tough global economic environment, Tesla needed to ""reduce its workforce by approximately 10 percent globally.

The latest news shows that Tesla has fired Christopher Bousigues, its regional manager in Singapore.

I also feel I should've taken profits at the top, but wanted to hold for life.

How do others take profits? What's your strategy? Do you DCA out, or take at key % points?

DETROIT (AP) — The government will soon release data on collisions involving vehicles with autonomous or partially automated driving systems that will likely single out Tesla for a disproportionately high number of such crashes.

In coming days, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to issue figures it has been gathering for nearly a year. The agency said in a separate report last week that it had documented more than 200 crashes involving Teslas that were using Autopilot, “Full Self-Driving,” Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or some other of the company’s partially automated systems.

Tesla’s figure and its crash rate per 1,000 vehicles was substantially higher than the corresponding numbers for other automakers that provided such data to The Associated Press ahead of NHTSA’s release. The number of Tesla collisions was revealed as part of a NHTSA investigation of Teslas on Autopilot that had crashed into emergency and other vehicles stopped along roadways.

Tesla does have many more vehicles with partly automated systems operating on U.S. roads than most other automakers do — roughly 830,000, dating to the 2014 model year. And it collects real-time data online from vehicles, so it has a much faster reporting system. Other automakers, by contrast, must wait for reports to arrive from the field and sometimes don’t learn about crashes for months.","source: detroit (ap) — government soon release data collisions involving vehicles autonomous partially automated driving systems likely single tesla disproportionately high number crashes. coming days, national highway traffic safety administration plans issue figures gathering nearly year. agency said separate report last week documented 200 crashes involving teslas using autopilot, “full self-driving,” traffic-aware cruise control company’s partially automated systems. tesla’s figure crash rate per 1,000 vehicles substantially higher corresponding numbers automakers provided data associated press ahead nhtsa’s release. number tesla collisions revealed part nhtsa investigation teslas autopilot crashed emergency vehicles stopped along roadways. tesla many vehicles partly automated systems operating u.s. roads automakers — roughly 830,000, dating 2014 model year. collects real-time data online vehicles, much faster reporting system. automakers, contrast, must wait reports arrive field sometimes don’t learn crashes months.","['Traffic-Aware Cruise Control', 'the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration', 'The Associated Press', 'Tesla', 'Autopilot', 'AP']"

*****

# [Dow futures fall more than 500 points as Wall Street loses Wednesday’s post-Fed rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were under pressure Thursday, putting the major averages to give up the solid gains made in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6%, or 500 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures shed 2.3%. All three futures contracts had earlier been trading in positive territory.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield resumed its massive June run on Thursday, reversing higher overnight. The 10-year yield was last around 3.44% after ending May at 2.84%.
*****
&gt; Those moves come after the Federal Reserve implemented its largest interest rate hike since 1994 on Wednesday. The Fed raised rates by 75 basis points, as was widely anticipated.
*****
&gt; “Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference following the decision.
*****
&gt; Stocks took a leg higher Wednesday after Powell said that a 50 or 75 basis point increase “seems most likely” at the next meeting in July, indicating the central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation. Powell did caution, however, that decisions will be made “meeting by meeting.”
*****
&gt; The major averages ended the session higher, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 both snapping five-day losing streaks. The 30-stock benchmark added about 304 points, or 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.46%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the relative outperformer, rising 2.5%.
*****
&gt; However, market sentiment appeared to sour once again Thursday as other central banks around the globe adopted more aggressive policy stances and investors questioned whether the Fed can pull off a soft landing.
*****
&gt; The Swiss National Bank overnight raised rates for the first time in 15 years. The Bank of England was set on Thursday to raise rates for the fifth straight time.
*****
&gt; “Central banks in Switzerland and Hungary hiked rates by more than anticipated (while Brazil hiked inline and Taiwan raised actually a bit less), continuing the trend of aggressive policy tightening globally (the BOE is expected to increase rates in less than two hours while the world piles pressure on the BOJ to defend its 25bp target),” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; “Meanwhile, gas prices are climbing in Europe as Russia dials back supplies further, creating increased inflationary pressures for the ECB. The combination of central bank tightening and upward pressures on energy costs is pushing yields higher around the world, undercutting equity sentiment,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tech shares moved lower in premarket trading following Wednesday’s bounce, with Tesla, PayPal, Nvidia, Amazon and Netflix all down more than 3%.
*****
&gt; “There is an astonishing level of tech selling right now,” wrote CNBC’s Jim Cramer in a tweet Thursday. “It is breathtaking to watch as sellers are sending the best techs down gigantically at 5 a.m.”
*****
&gt; Travel stocks including United, Delta and Carnival also took a leg lower.
*****
&gt; The major averages entered Thursday’s session down for the week and well below record levels.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both in bear market territory, down roughly 21% and 32% from their all-time highs in January and November, respectively. The Dow, meantime, is 17% below its Jan. 5 all-time intraday high.
*****
&gt; Rampant inflation, which is at the highest level in 40 years, has weighed on the major averages, as have fears around slowing economic growth and the possibility of a recession.
*****
&gt; Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson warned that the inflation problem won’t be solved overnight.
*****
&gt; “It also raises the risk of a recession because you’re bringing forward rate hikes even faster, and I don’t think it’s going to help the bond market,” he said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; Economic data out Thursday includes weekly jobless claims numbers, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones forecasting a 220,000 print. Housing starts will also be released, while Adobe and Kroger will report quarterly updates.

1655396324,43,"Teladoc ($TDOC) was one of the most volatile stocks in the last few years. The share price increased 10x from $33 (5 years ago) to almost $300 at the peak of Feb 2021. Since then, the price declined by 90% and is now back in the $30s.

I've spoken with quite some retail investors and it's so interesting to see the two opposing views. Some are very optimistic about Teladoc and expect the price will go back to the all-time highs. While others are expecting the price to go below $10 and are short-selling the stock.

The goal of this post is to share my fundamental analysis and valuation. Feel free to provide your feedback, add your own insights, and disagree with me :)

It is good to mention that the market cap is $5b, we can keep this number in mind when comparing it to other parts of the financials later on. Let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Teladoc?**

Teladoc is a global leader in whole personal virtual care. It is challenging the traditional model for hospital visits for non-urgent mattes and provides a new, more convenient alternative, that is available 24/7. It has been referred to as Uber for doctors. Patients can use the Teladoc platform to schedule online visits and connect with the right healthcare professional, whether that's related to acute care, specialty care, mental health, or wellness &amp; prevention (including prescription). Teladoc stores a significant amount of data regarding the patients that can be analyzed using AI and provide meaningful insights that can easily be used.

Related to the service provided through the platform, 92% of all issues are solved in 1 virtual visit and 1% are being referred to emergency care. This means the platform does a good job of connecting the patient with the right healthcare professional.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Teladoc make money?**

Teladoc has two main revenue sources:

1. Access (subscription) fees - In the majority of the cases, employers pay this fee on behalf of their employees ($14.99/month or $99/annually). This is roughly 85% of the revenue, which makes Teladoc mainly a B2B company. This is a subscription that allows the employees to access the platform and schedule virtual visits/appointments on their own. Hence, this is a pretty high-margin revenue.
2. Visit fees - Although the majority of the payment for the virtual visits goes from the patient to the doctor, Teladoc keeps a small % of it as a ""visit fee"". This is a lower-margin revenue and it represents the remaining portion of Teladoc's revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Teladoc grow?**

If we take into account the revenue sources, it is clear that Teladoc grows in two ways:

1. Provide access to more members and hence increase the access fees. - Teladoc has almost 55m paid members in the US and it can be argued that the US market is already highly penetrated with limited growth ahead. Of course, internationally, there's still room to grow, but there are plenty of other competitors as well and the rates are likely to be much lower than in the US.
2. Increase the # of visits which leads to higher visit fees. - The company publishes a so-called utilization rate, which is calculated as the # of visits divided by the # of members. This rate has increased from 17.5% in Q1/2021 to 23.4% in Q1/2022. Roughly 1/5 of the members use the platform and schedule meetings. I find this a bit difficult to increase significantly. The nature of the service doesn't allow the company to upsell/cross-sell, with the exception of the nutrition/wellness segment. However, that very segment is highly competitive in the first place and there are cheaper alternatives.

**Livongo - the elephant in the room**

Historically, the growth has come from a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. In 2020, Teladoc acquired Livongo and the purchase price was $13.9b (net of cash received). The fair value of the balance sheet of Livongo was roughly $1b, which lead to goodwill recognition of a staggering $12.9b. Of course, the majority of that purchase price was in the form of stock and at the acquisition point, both Teladoc and Livongo were significantly overvalued. However, let's not forget that the market cap of Teladoc today (including Livongo) is $5b, a lot less than the acquisition of Livongo on its own.

Livongo is also a company that operates in the industry, providing a device that allows the patients to measure certain important aspects on their own. They're mainly focused on diabetes management/prevention, high blood pressure, and weight management.

Fast forward to Q1/2022, Teladoc reported a goodwill impairment of $6.6b, roughly 50% of the goodwill initially recognized.

**Why was the goodwill impairment and what does this mean?**

Every company has to do so-called goodwill impairment testing annually. In a nutshell, the company needs to forecast the future cash flows that are expected to be generated from the acquisition, discount it to today and compare it with what they have on the balance sheet (including the goodwill). If the outcome is higher than what the company has on the balance sheet, then nothing happens. But if the outcome is lower, they need to impair the goodwill.

This impairment means that Teladoc forecasted the future cash flows and discounted them to today and the outcome was $6.6b lower than what they expected at the point of acquisition.

What is interesting is that there's still over $6b of goodwill related to Livongo only, so Teladoc still believes that Livongo is worth over $6b. The market disagrees significantly as it prices the entire company lower than what Teladoc is valuing Livongo alone.

Goodwill impairment is a non-cash expense, so although it is in the P&amp;L, it has no significant impact on the company's financials. However, it does raise two of the main risks when it comes to making big acquisitions:

1. Selecting the right company that will create synergy.
2. Integrating the acquired company into the existing environment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

If we take a look at the revenue growth, it increased from $233m for the full-year 2017 to $2.1b for the last twelve months (ending Q1/2022). Although it is impressive annual growth, a lot of that came from the acquisitions. The organic growth was close to 40% CAGR. The expected growth for 2022 is close to 20%, which shows that the growth is quite limited ahead (at least organically).

The gross margin is currently around 68% and depending on which revenue source contributes more, it could fluctuate in both directions. The main direct costs that are being incurred are fees paid to doctors, data center activities, and client support.

&amp;#x200B;

Operating expenses:

**- Sales &amp; Marketing** \- As % of revenue, it has decreased from 41% (in 2021) to 33% (LTM). That is roughly $700m and it can be argued that it might not be producing high RoI based on the revenue growth.

**- Technology &amp; Development** \- Stable at 15% of revenue

**- General &amp; Administrative** \- Significantly decreased from 34% (in 2021) to 20% of revenue (LTM)

**- Depreciation &amp; Amortization** \- Increased from 8.2% (in 2021) to 10% (LTM)

**The operating margin** has improved from -32% (in 2021) to -12% (LTM, excluding the $6.6b goodwill impairment).

&amp;#x200B;

**Liquidity**

Although the company's operating margin is negative, part of the costs are paid via share-based compensation, so the company's operating cash flow seems positive as this is a non-cash expense. However, this of course leads to dilution of shares. It is worth mentioning that it does help when it comes to the short/mid-term liquidity challenges in this environment and reduces the risk of bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

The goodwill remaining on the balance sheet arising from all historical acquisitions ($7.9b), together with the other intangible assets ($1.9b), and the cash ($0.8b) comprises 96% of Teladoc's balance sheet ($11.1b).

On the liability side, the most important topic worth mentioning is the long-term debt and leases, amounting to $1.6b (2x the cash the company has available).

The company is capital-light, so the focus should be mainly on the $0.8m cash and $1.6b debt.

&amp;#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value. The assumptions are listed below:

**Revenue growth:** 20% in the next 12 months, followed by 15% in the 4 years after that and declining growth over time to 3.41% in 10 years' time. This is in line with analysts' expectations for the next 2 years as well as the management's guidance.

**Operating margin:** to improve over time, to reach 9% in year 5 and  25% in year 10.

**Discount rate:** Currently 7%, increasing to 10.6% over time (as the fed is raising the interest rate)

**Outcome**: $38.77/share

\*Note: In the DCF calculation, the outstanding equity options are also taken into account as well as the deferred tax that they can use to reduce their future tax payments.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on my assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 208% to $6.6b in the next 10 years and the target operating margin is 25%.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) changes based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|150% ($5.4b)|$21.9|$31.0|$40.1|
|208% ($6.6b)|$27.8|$38.8|$49.8|
|300% ($8.6b)|$37.3|$51.3|$65.3|
|350% ($9.6b)|$42.5|$58.1|$73.8|

There is still quite some uncertainty ahead of Teladoc and it is clear that the level of success depends on the # of new members they can bring to their platform as well as the utilization rate. Looking into the two opposite views, I'm in the middle. I don't think that Teladoc will go down to $0 as there is a value that the platform is providing and I don't see a bankruptcy risk. However, I don't think that going back to the levels of $300 in the next few years is also reasonable (at least based on the fundamentals).","teladoc ($tdoc) one volatile stocks last years. share price increased 10x $33 (5 years ago) almost $300 peak feb 2021. since then, price declined 90% back $30s. spoken quite retail investors interesting see two opposing views. optimistic teladoc expect price go back all-time highs. others expecting price go $10 short-selling stock. goal post share fundamental analysis valuation. feel free provide feedback, add insights, disagree :) good mention market cap $5b, keep number mind comparing parts financials later on. let's get started! #x200b;

1655412989,55,"Mentally it’s tough to keep buying with non-stop red days. Here’s a long term perspective to consider.

AAPL is now down 30%, but a return to all time high means a 183/129 = 42% return. If you’re happy with an average annual return of 10%, then buying now means AAPL has 4 years to get back to ATH in order for it to be a good investment for you. 

Obviously a faster return to ATH gives an even better average return. (I oversimplify the math a little by ignoring compounding)

A similar analysis on these blue chips shows that a return to ATH in,

- MSFT: 4.5 years

- GOOG: 5 years

- AMZN: 8 years

Would equate to an average annual return of ~10%.

1655474106,1,"Today I opened five small positions. For me, these are growth-oriented plays and two gambles. The three safer ones are not the most risky bets, they are stocks I would certainly hold right now if I had positions in them, expecting them to do well long-term. And the two gambles are the obvious ones right now.

\- MSFT: Little high P/E (around 27) for my taste, but they're 25% down YTD, and they have enough cash that they are a bit on a shopping spree. They're not doing bad, so I see a bigger upside than downside here. I like companies that buy other companies, shows they have money to do that.

\- AAPL: I said to myself last year when they hit 20 P/E I'll buy. We're at 21. It's a calm day after a bad day. They won't go broke anytime soon. More upside than downside for me.

\- GOOGL: There have been threads a month or two ago seeing this as a great play, at P/E of around 25 back then. I looked at it, and it still felt slightly expensive, but definitely interesting. Now at 19 P/E.

\- ATVI: Now this is the first bet. It's Warren Buffett's arbitrage play. My reasoning is if I'm bullish on MSFT I might as well do this as well. If the deal goes through, that's +25%. If it doesn't, that might be a downside temporarily, but they're doing well by themselves long term...

\- TWTR: This is the wild bet. Usually anything with Elon Musk connected to it is too risky for my taste (in any direction! I'm neither buying nor shorting TSLA). But if I ignore March 2020 they've been trading between 28 and 50 the last couple of years, before Musk Madness hit. Elon might be forced to pay the 54.20, then it's 45% up. He might renegotiate the price, that will be some compromise, but likely still well above the current price. Or the deal might fail completely, but I honestly see limited downside even in that case, especially long-term, they're not going away anytime soon. I think the second scenario is the most likely, with the other two being possible. I'm guessing this is much better than inflation as an expected value.

Again, I'm not betting my livelihood on these 5, it's a smallish position. But I have to start buying something at some point after the market went down so much. I don't know when the recovery starts, but if I never buy I can't profit off it. 

I might lose money temporarily if they go down more, but that's always a possibility.","today opened five small positions. me, growth-oriented plays two gambles. three safer ones risky bets, stocks would certainly hold right positions them, expecting well long-term. two gambles obvious ones right now. \- msft: little high p/e (around 27) taste, 25% ytd, enough cash bit shopping spree. bad, see bigger upside downside here. like companies buy companies, shows money that. \- aapl: said last year hit 20 p/e buy. 21. calm day bad day. go broke anytime soon. upside downside me. \- googl: threads month two ago seeing great play, p/e around 25 back then. looked it, still felt slightly expensive, definitely interesting. 19 p/e. \- atvi: first bet. warren buffett's arbitrage play. reasoning bullish msft might well well. deal goes through, that's +25%. doesn't, might downside temporarily, well long term... \- twtr: wild bet. usually anything elon musk connected risky taste (in direction! neither buying shorting tsla). ignore march 2020 trading 28 50 last couple years, musk madness hit. elon might forced pay 54.20, 45% up. might renegotiate price, compromise, likely still well current price. deal might fail completely, honestly see limited downside even case, especially long-term, going away anytime soon. think second scenario likely, two possible. guessing much better inflation expected value. again, betting livelihood 5, smallish position. start buying something point market went much. know recovery starts, never buy can't profit it. might lose money temporarily go more, that's always possibility.","['Apple', 'Tesla', 'YTD', 'TWTR', 'Alphabet', 'Microsoft']"

Amazon is facing a looming crisis: It could run out of people to hire in its US warehouses by 2024, according to leaked Amazon internal research from mid-2021 that Recode reviewed. If that happens, the online retailer’s service quality and growth plans could be at risk, and its e-commerce dominance along with it. Raising wages and increasing warehouse automation are two of the six “levers” Amazon could pull to delay this labor crisis by a few years, but only a series of sweeping changes to how the company does business and manages its employees will significantly alter the timeline, Amazon staff predicted. “If we continue business as usual, Amazon will deplete the available labor supply in the US network by 2024,” the research, which hasn’t previously been reported, says.

The report warned that Amazon’s labor crisis was especially imminent in a few locales, with internal models showing that the company was expected to exhaust its entire available labor pool in the Phoenix, Arizona, metro area by the end of 2021, and in the Inland Empire region of California, roughly 60 miles east of Los Angeles, by the end of 2022. Amazon’s internal report calculated the available pool of workers based on characteristics like income levels and a household’s proximity to current or planned Amazon facilities; the pool does not include the entire US adult population. The research provides a rare glimpse into the staffing challenges that Amazon is now facing behind its slick veil of one-click online shopping and same-day Prime delivery. And it pointedly reveals how much of Amazon’s business success and its longtime position as a darling of Wall Street investors is dependent on its workforce of more than 1 million people who pick, pack, and ship its customers’ orders nearly 24/7.

The leakedinternal findings also serve as a cautionary tale for other employers who seek to emulate the Amazon Way of management, which emphasizes worker productivity over just about everything else and churns through the equivalent of its entire front-line workforce year after year. In the past, that churn wasn’t a problem for Amazon — it was even desirable at some points. Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos saw his warehouse workforce as necessary but replaceable, and feared that workers who remained at the company too long would turn complacent or, worse, disgruntled, according to reporting by the New York Times. But now, as the internal report Recode reviewed shows, some inside Amazon are realizing that strategy won’t work much longer, especially if leaders truly want to transform it into “Earth’s best employer,” as Bezos proclaimed in 2021.

With traditional competitors ramping up their investments in e-commerce warehouses, Amazon is no longer a slam-dunk top choice for those seeking work in these types of facilities and the starting minimum wage that comes along with it. And that dynamic is already playing out in some parts of the country. In the Inland Empire region of California, for example, Amazon may cycle through every worker who’d be interested in applying for a warehouse job by the end of 2022, the internal report warned. One of the reasons is that Amazon is increasingly finding itself in a bidding war for workers with rivals in the area, which is a key logistics region because it is within a two-hour drive of 20 million potential customers and two of the largest container ports in the US. “We are hearing a lot of [Amazon] workers say, ‘I can just go across the street to Target or Walmart,’” said Sheheryar Kaoosji, co-executive director of an Inland Empire nonprofit called the Warehouse Worker Resource Center. Kaoosji added that Walmart is offering some workers with past warehouse experience as much as $25 an hour. An Amazon executive told Reuters in late 2021 that the company was bumping the average starting wage for new hires in the US to more than$18 an hour, attributing the decision to intense competition among employers. He also said Amazon had increased hiring bonuses to as much as $3,000 in some geographies.","amazon facing looming crisis: could run people hire us warehouses 2024, according leaked amazon internal research mid-2021 recode reviewed. happens, online retailer’s service quality growth plans could risk, e-commerce dominance along it. raising wages increasing warehouse automation two six “levers” amazon could pull delay labor crisis years, series sweeping changes company business manages employees significantly alter timeline, amazon staff predicted. “if continue business usual, amazon deplete available labor supply us network 2024,” research, hasn’t previously reported, says. report warned amazon’s labor crisis especially imminent locales, internal models showing company expected exhaust entire available labor pool phoenix, arizona, metro area end 2021, inland empire region california, roughly 60 miles east los angeles, end 2022. amazon’s internal report calculated available pool workers based characteristics like income levels household’s proximity current planned amazon facilities; pool include entire us adult population. research provides rare glimpse staffing challenges amazon facing behind slick veil one-click online shopping same-day prime delivery. pointedly reveals much amazon’s business success longtime position darling wall street investors dependent workforce 1 million people pick, pack, ship customers’ orders nearly 24/7. leakedinternal findings also serve cautionary tale employers seek emulate amazon way management, emphasizes worker productivity everything else churns equivalent entire front-line workforce year year. past, churn wasn’t problem amazon — even desirable points. amazon founder former ceo jeff bezos saw warehouse workforce necessary replaceable, feared workers remained company long would turn complacent or, worse, disgruntled, according reporting new york times. now, internal report recode reviewed shows, inside amazon realizing strategy won’t work much longer, especially leaders truly want transform “earth’s best employer,” bezos proclaimed 2021. traditional competitors ramping investments e-commerce warehouses, amazon longer slam-dunk top choice seeking work types facilities starting minimum wage comes along it. dynamic already playing parts country. inland empire region california, example, amazon may cycle every worker who’d interested applying warehouse job end 2022, internal report warned. one reasons amazon increasingly finding bidding war workers rivals area, key logistics region within two-hour drive 20 million potential customers two largest container ports us. “we hearing lot workers say, ‘i go across street target walmart,’” said sheheryar kaoosji, co-executive director inland empire nonprofit called warehouse worker resource center. kaoosji added walmart offering workers past warehouse experience much $25 hour. amazon executive told reuters late 2021 company bumping average starting wage new hires us than$18 hour, attributing decision intense competition among employers. also said amazon increased hiring bonuses much $3,000 geographies.","['the Warehouse Worker Resource Center', 'Amazon', 'Inland Empire', 'Target', 'Recode', 'Reuters', 'the New York Times', 'Walmart']"

1655755122,22,"I work for UPS as a driver and have no shares of UPS.

I'd like to have a discussion on what are your thoughts will happen to UPS's share price once the new contract comes into place. The union and UPS renegotiate every 5 years for their contract and the next contract ends July 31, 2023.

With a new union president and work place/force situation worldwide, there are high expectations for this new contract from higher wages, more vacation time and more.

 One thing I'd like to point out is there are two types of drivers, but do the exact same job. 22.4 driver is Tuesday-Saturday and is basically a cover driver and is used for whatever the company needs for the day. The second type of driver is a RCPD driver which is basically having your own area every day Monday-Friday, although there are some RCPD cover driver positions. You go from 22.4 to RCPD by having seniority.

The big difference is 22.4 makes less money than the RCPD. Both classes of drivers go through a 4 year progression of pay. On a side note if you are on year 2 of being a 22.4 and you get a RCPD position, you jump to year 2 of RCPD. 

Pay may differ depending on area, but this is mine.

22.4.                       
start:   $20.50.       
year 1: $21.75.      
year 2: $22.75.      
year 3: $25.00.      
year 4: $30.64.      

RCPD
$21.00.
$23.00.
$24.00.
$28.75.
$40.00ish.

The company takes advantage of the 22.4s and slams them with extra work so they don't have to pay as much over time to the RCPDs. The union wants to dismantle the 22.4 position and make everyone a RCPD. I'd expect their days worked would stay the same. We all have Sundays off in my area.

The union also wants to cut down the pay progression from 4 years to 2. The company also needs to pay more for warehouse workers who load/unload trucks every morning and night as they can't attract any workers to stay very long.

Do you think if the share price gets back up to the $200 range, would it be smart to consider a short position with these massive changes and a possible union strike next year?

I'd also point out that UPS has made MASSIVE gains over the past couple of years and it doesn't seem to be slowing down by a lot as it's the new norm. I don't consider amazon a threat, but I do believe they will take business away in the long term. UPS had a contract with Amazon to deliver their packages, but didn't make a ton of money on all the small packages. I believe amazon delivery is bigger in the big cities, but out in smaller areas they haven't reached that yet and that's where we come in.

&gt; Stock futures rose in early morning trading Tuesday following a brutal week as investors assessed a more aggressive Federal Reserve and rising chances of a recession.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 404 points, or 1.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 1.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures popped 1.4%. U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for Juneteenth.

&gt; “There’s not a single reason for the bounce in equities, and the overwhelming view is dismissing the uptick as being nothing more than dead cat, something that should be faded just like all the other rally attempts lately. We push back a little bit on that view, largely because of an approaching inflation shift,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; Crisafulli noted that Brent crude was trading roughly $10 below a recent high, while President Joe Biden gets set for a trip to Saudi Arabia to discuss energy production. He also pointed out that iron ore and copper have fallen recently.

1655858014,20,"Recap on yesterdays market action:

* SPY closed up 2.52%
* QQQ closed up 2.33%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 2.15%

Today was a good start to the market rally and recovery but we still have a lot of ground to cover before the bear market is truly shook. As for market news we still have the Fed Chair speaking Wednesday and Thursday and this may have an impact on the markets.

SPY broke back above the resistance trendline (support lines become resistance once they have been broken). Even though SPY broke above the line it did so on below average volume and started to fade into the close. If SPY can base above the trendline for a few days and then stage a rally that would be very productive.

QQQ never broke below its support trendline, however this does not mean that it is performing stronger than SPY. Today it was up on below average volume and also faded into the close, closing about halfway through the daily range. Similarly to SPY, if QQQ could base for a few days and then advance on volume that would start to signal a rally.

GOOGL triggered a buy today when it took out Wednesdays high with volume. I considered opening a small position but missed the alert and by the time I saw it GOOGL had advanced approximately 1% past the buy point. Even if I had opened a position I likely would have sold partial shares (20% of position) near the high and more shares (50% of remaining position) when GOOGL came back to my buy point. This market is very choppy and thus makes take partial profits quickly essential. As of now GOOGL needs to take out the June 10th high with volume to be considered a buy.

TSLA is acting slightly stronger that GOOGL at the moment. Also advancing past Wednesdays high with volume although we did see a fade into the close. Similarly to GOOGL I had planned to buy taking out the highs but missed the alerts (I was occupied with a meeting). TSLA did form a downward sloping trendline that may provide an entry if it is taken out with volume and a good market.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, todays price action was constructive but no enough to become extremely bullish. This is simply one step on the long road to a health market. The indices may setup up for an entry but profits need to be taken quick and losses even quicker. As for individual stocks that show high probability setups they are few and far in between. My true favorites are currently only GOOGL and TSLA, more may soon be added to this list. Stay focused and watch your stocks because the market has the ability to turn quickly.","recap yesterdays market action: * spy closed 2.52% * qqq closed 2.33% * dow jones industrial closed 2.15% today good start market rally recovery still lot ground cover bear market truly shook. market news still fed chair speaking wednesday thursday may impact markets. spy broke back resistance trendline (support lines become resistance broken). even though spy broke line average volume started fade close. spy base trendline days stage rally would productive. qqq never broke support trendline, however mean performing stronger spy. today average volume also faded close, closing halfway daily range. similarly spy, qqq could base days advance volume would start signal rally. googl triggered buy today took wednesdays high volume. considered opening small position missed alert time saw googl advanced approximately 1% past buy point. even opened position likely would sold partial shares (20% position) near high shares (50% remaining position) googl came back buy point. market choppy thus makes take partial profits quickly essential. googl needs take june 10th high volume considered buy. tsla acting slightly stronger googl moment. also advancing past wednesdays high volume although see fade close. similarly googl planned buy taking highs missed alerts (i occupied meeting). tsla form downward sloping trendline may provide entry taken volume good market. #x200b; overall, todays price action constructive enough become extremely bullish. simply one step long road health market. indices may setup entry profits need taken quick losses even quicker. individual stocks show high probability setups far between. true favorites currently googl tsla, may soon added list. stay focused watch stocks market ability turn quickly.","['SPY', 'Alphabet', 'QQQ', 'Tesla']"

&amp;#x200B;

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the RFS, is expected to unveil proposed changes to the policy sometime this year, defining new winners and losers in a multibillion-dollar market for credits, known as RINs, that has supported corn growers and biofuels producers for more than a decade. 

 The Biden White House has been an unapologetic supporter of the EV industry, pinning much of its climate hopes on getting more electric cars on the road. The bipartisan infrastructure bill that passed last year included $7.5 billion for new EV charging stations and Biden has sought to reinstate expired tax credits to help consumers pay for new vehicles. 

 The Biden EPA has had additional meetings on the topic with Tesla, groups representing biogas producers like Waste Management Inc [**(WM.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/WM.N) and Republic Services Inc [**(RSG.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/RSG.N) and charging station companies like ChargePoint Holdings Inc [**(CHPT.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/CHPT.N), according to the documents. 

Matthew Nelson, a lobbyist with Electrify America, a charging company trade group, wrote to the EPA in October and told them that e-RINs would do more to enable Biden's 2030 goals of 500,000 charging stations and 50% EV sales than any other policy, according to the emails. He added that charging companies need the credit to compete with gasoline.

The United States currently has about 48,000 charging stations, concentrated around coastal regions, according to Department of Energy data.

Biogas producers, like landfills, also want credits, arguing they provide renewable fuel to the grid that generates the power for electric vehicles.

Biogas-derived electricity is already eligible for generating RINs. But the EPA has never approved an application from the industry because it has yet to determine the best way to trace the power entering EVs back to its origin.

In 2020, landfill gas generated about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, or 0.3% of U.S. utility-scale power.

1656097217,13,"Or did they willingly cancel 700,000 Russian accounts?

Some reports are saying 1 million accounts were lost in Russia, Netflix used the number 700,000 in a letter to shareholders, so we can go with that.

In order to forcibly remove 700,000 users but only show a loss of 200,000, they would have needed to gain 500,000 users.

If they had not cut off Russia they would not have reported a loss.

But wait, they're expecting a loss of 2 million subscribers next quarter you say, well that would be roughly half a million down from the amount they lost in the last 5 quarters (2.5 million).

The next competition in streaming is Amazon, which has about 20 million fewer subscribers. And who also provides a streaming service packaged with Amazon Prime, so it's not really a fair comparison.

The rest of the competitors including Disney+ are 100-200 million subscribers behind.

And they estimate about 100 million accounts are being shared with additional households. So there are 100 million customers who are using the service without paying, and arrogantly believe it's their right too, so much so that they're offended at the idea that Netflix is going to offer a free tier with ads.

And there seems to be a sentiment that because you personally don't like the content they've been producing that they are producing content that nobody wants. [Here's a list of their most-viewed original content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-watched_Netflix_original_programming). **Netflix has nearly a decade's head-start on gathering user analytics.** They are producing content that they know people will watch. Remember, the general public is not made up of refined connoisseurs of entertainment.

The only valid concern for Netflix at this point is their negative cash flow, but that's never been a problem before. They are committed to developing original programming. Original programming can be an asset that remains valuable essentially forever, just look at how popular ""Friends"", ""Seinfeld"", &amp; ""The Office"" are decades after they were made.

And no other streaming services is as committed to stand-up comedy as Netflix, being a big comedy fan myself this is a big plus.

I can't help but get the feeling that everyone is completely overflowing Netflix's last report, and the information about Russia is being ignored because it doesn't serve the juicy headlines about Netflix ending their growth streak.

Disclosure: I do not currently hold any positions in Netflix.

1656318855,140,"Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) lead over other automakers in the EV race is only enhanced by headwinds, says Credit Suisse. While the manufacturer faces a tough quarter, the firm sees plenty of reason to be optimistic about its stock.

Credit Suisse's Dan Levy expects Tesla to announce Q2 deliveries of 242,000 vehicles, below the consensus estimate of around 273,000. Regardless, the bullish outlook for TSLA is “is amplified” given the company's strong positioning, he wrote. The analyst is confident that Tesla remains the world leader in electric vehicles, and with the deterioration of the global situation with the supply chain, its leadership will only increase.

“We believe the long-term case for Tesla is clear–Tesla remains the global leader in EVs, and amid rising supply chain risks, we believe Tesla's lead over other automakers in the race to EV is only amplified given its lead in vertical integration and its prior EV experience,” Levy wrote.

Although Levy cut Tesla's share price target to $1,000 from $1,125, he looked beyond this quarter alone and kept the outperform rating on the shares that he established back in January. Although Giga Shanghai is underperforming in Q2, the analyst expects a sharp rise in the second half of the year. Despite all the headwinds, which are short-term, the long-term positive outlook on Tesla is provided by fundamental indicators.

“[We]continue to believe in our thesis that robust fundamentals ahead should outweigh the near-term challenges for Tesla such as the recent growth selloff, production disruptions in China, lingering semiconductor failure and magnified inflationary pressures,” Levy wrote.

TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain unlimited demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --&gt; $3750 --&gt; $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --&gt; higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

* SPY closed down 0.38%
* QQQ closed down 0.73%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.20%
* VIX closed down 1.10%

The major indices all gapped up to open and quickly gave back their gains to close slightly lower on the day. Although many stocks closed down for the day this was still a constructive and much needed rest after last Friday's large gains. With that being said, don't get overly bullish just yet. We still have a long ways to go before the market shakes off the past few months.

SPY ran into the 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) right at the opened and quickly reversed. This was not an extremely strong reversal however, with volume lower than Fridays run up and the average daily trading volume. What would be most constructive is if SPY ranged here for a few days to a week and then looked to advance even farther. SPY could also setup for a high-low by trending downwards slightly and then taking out todays highs. Conversely, if we see strong selling in the next few days this may indicate more downwards action. 

QQQ behaved similarly to SPY, however, QQQ actually gapped up above its 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) but still closed slightly below. A week of range trading or even a slight downward trend would be constructive for QQQ as it would give some time before attempting a new advance. 

**Recap on recent positions:**

Before the close on last Thursday I opened two small positions in AMZN &amp; QLD. Both performed very well and Friday and today I was stopped out of both positions. 

My first shares of AMZN where bought at the pivot point shown by the yellow line. This was at the close of Thursday and as prices began to advance on Friday I bought a small amount of additional shares. Today I sold out of this position for a moderate gain of 1.80%. This is not an eye popping gain but in a choppy/whipsaw market I find it best to take smaller profits.

QLD also turned out to be a nice buy into the close on Thursday. There was a slightly better base/enter here so my initial position was slightly larger. Again, with Fridays price advance I bought additional shares throughout the day. Today I also sold all of my shares for an average gain of 4.30%. Could I have held to a few shares? Yes. Will I regret not? No. If QLD continues to advance there are several additional entry points possible.

**Potential Setups:** 

Looking forward there are not many stocks that currently have high probability setups.

GOOGL was discussed previously and has approached a month long base. If GOOGL can break above the highs set today with a large volume increase this could be the beginnings of a good run.

O is also approaching a monthly base. This is very similar to GOOGL with the only difference being the O is a realty trust and thus may move bit slower in price increases.

Overall, market conditions are improving marginally compared to what they were two weeks ago. With that being said conditions can change quickly and price could revert to new lows. All we are able to do now is to create a list of potential stocks that are setting up or close to setting up. Market conditions still have a long way to go but always have to start changing somewhere.","**recap yesterdays market action:** * spy closed 0.38% * qqq closed 0.73% * dow jones industrial closed 0.20% * vix closed 1.10% major indices gapped open quickly gave back gains close slightly lower day. although many stocks closed day still constructive much needed rest last friday's large gains. said, get overly bullish yet. still long ways go market shakes past months. spy ran 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) right opened quickly reversed. extremely strong reversal however, volume lower fridays run average daily trading volume. would constructive spy ranged days week looked advance even farther. spy could also setup high-low trending downwards slightly taking todays highs. conversely, see strong selling next days may indicate downwards action. qqq behaved similarly spy, however, qqq actually gapped 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) still closed slightly below. week range trading even slight downward trend would constructive qqq would give time attempting new advance. **recap recent positions:** close last thursday opened two small positions amzn qld. performed well friday today stopped positions. first shares amzn bought pivot point shown yellow line. close thursday prices began advance friday bought small amount additional shares. today sold position moderate gain 1.80%. eye popping gain choppy/whipsaw market find best take smaller profits. qld also turned nice buy close thursday. slightly better base/enter initial position slightly larger. again, fridays price advance bought additional shares throughout day. today also sold shares average gain 4.30%. could held shares? yes. regret not? no. qld continues advance several additional entry points possible. **potential setups:** looking forward many stocks currently high probability setups. googl discussed previously approached month long base. googl break highs set today large volume increase could beginnings good run. also approaching monthly base. similar googl difference realty trust thus may move bit slower price increases. overall, market conditions improving marginally compared two weeks ago. said conditions change quickly price could revert new lows. able create list potential stocks setting close setting up. market conditions still long way go always start changing somewhere.","['Alphabet', 'Amazon', 'QQQ', 'QLD', 'SPY']"

1656434933,136,""" 

**MIAMI** (CNN) -- The chaotic mix of record fuel prices and an unending supply chain crisis have retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items, just keep them.

In recent weeks, some of the biggest store chains, including Target, Walmart, Gap, American Eagle Outfitters and others have reported in their latest earnings calls that they have too much inventory of stuff ranging from workout clothes, spring-time jackets and hoodies to garden furniture and bulky kids' toys. It's costing them tons of money to store it.

Now add on to that glut another category of product that stores have to deal with: returns.

So instead of piling returned merchandise onto this growing inventory heap, stores are considering just handing customers their money back and letting them hang onto the stuff they don't want.

""It would be a smart strategic initiative,"" said Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. ""Retailers are stuck with excess inventory of unprecedented levels. They can't afford to take back even more of it.""

Returned products are handled in a number of different ways, he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer, evaluate it, and if it's in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price.

They can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe, Canada or Mexico.

""Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages, sending product overseas isn't really an option,"" said Flickinger. Lastly, retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.

Each of these options, however, tack on additional costs for retailers, he said.

""For every dollar in sales, a retailer's net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns, for every dollar in returned merchandise, it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it,"" said Flickinger.

There is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that's to consider a 'returnless return,' said Steve Rop, chief operating officer with goTRG, a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart, Amazon and Lowe's.

**Just keep it**  
Rop said his company's clients are 100% considering offering the ""keep it"" option for returns this year, although he wouldn't disclose if any of his customers have implemented the ""Keep it"" returns policy yet.

In some instances, when they determine it would be easier, some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. 

""They're already discounting in stores to clear out products but, when there's heavy discounting, buyer's remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later,"" he said.

Refunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn't a new practice, said Rop. ""It started with Amazon several years ago,"" he said.

The offer makes sense for some types of products -- lower price-tier bulky items like furniture, kitchen appliances, home decor, baby chairs, walkers, strollers where it's costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.

""Other products like kids' toys, footwear, towels, and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories,"" he said.

Another concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products, so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule -- and may not be worth the tradeoff, says Keith Daniels, partner with Carl Marks Advisors.

Still, a ""keep it"" policy has its own disadvantages, namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don't become victims of fraud.

""One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the \[Keep it\] policy do not begin to abuse it, by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise,"" said Daniels.""

Lost about half from that glorious top last year. Better than Cathie Wood though, yay! BTW remember 2020? Everyone loved Cathie. Genomic revolution, yada yada. Now everyone hates Cathie of course.

Ok, enough about Cathie. So after 20/21 marvelous returns (around 100% combined) I thought..holy s***, this is great, I got this...going to pay off my wife medical school loan earlier (a tip: *don't marry anyone with medical school loan debt*), maybe we will get bigger house, you know, man can dream (well now at 6% interest rates plus houses being ridiculously overpriced this is not happening regardless of how stock market is doing).  

Then 2022 came... Well, I shifted a good chunk of portfolio into GOOGL/AMZN from growth last year, about 20% allocation, but that didn't help much. Biotech in particular has been in BRUTAL bear marker ever. Btw average investor should NOT touch biotechs, especially small cap ones. But if you want to gamble and lose money anyway in the end, sure, go ahead and invest in biotechs, especially development stage ones. 

What I learned though during this bear market, *well energy or big pharma bros would say, what bear market are you talking about*, that your conviction absolutely helps you to hold on to equities during steep corrections. If you did enough due diligence and know what you own, you most likely will stick around even after &gt; 50% decline. If you bought something on borrowed conviction, then most likely you are shaken out by this time. 

Hang in there folks, better times will come, unless of course you bought oversized position in Teladoc or Carvana on top 😬
Bear markets are unavoidable. We just need to be mentally prepared for those. Macro bros / FCF ""experts"" / perma bears think we are going way lower. The thing is that *nobody* knows. I continue DCAing at this point. I won't catch a bottom and I don't need to honestly. Also all sectors do NOT decline equally as well.

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed as Wall Street tries to regain its footing](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were mixed on Wednesday morning, after the major averages made a failed attempt at a bounce in the previous session, and as the market prepares to close out the worst first half of the year since 1970.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher by 31 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Investors are still searching for the bottom of a vicious market sell-off as the second quarter comes to an end Thursday. Concern over a slowing economy and aggressive rate hikes consumed much of the first half of 2022, and fears of a recession fears are rising.
*****
&gt; “We expect significant volatility this summer, with ‘face-ripping’ short-covering rallies followed by economically-inspired market slumps,” Well Fargo senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said in a note Wednesday. “While a much anticipated market ‘washout’ could catalyze a more sustained move higher, we think the market will not sustain a rally until it believes the Fed will toggle from a 50-75bp tightening to a more mundane 25bp increase.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500, which is down about 20% in 2022, is on pace for its worst first half of the year since 1970, when the index lost 21.01%. Meanwhile, on a quarterly basis, both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on track for their worst performance since 2020. The Nasdaq is headed toward its worst three-month period since 2008.
*****
&gt; In early trading Wednesday, Carnival Corp slid nearly 8% in premarket trading after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the stock in half and said it could potentially go to zero in the face of another demand shock. The call dragged other cruise stocks lower. Royal Carribean lost 4% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings fell 3%.
*****
&gt; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares plummeted more than 14% after the company posted a huge miss on quarterly earnings and revenue expectations and announced its CEO is stepping down.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Pinterest shares jumped more than 4% on news that CEO Ben Silbermann is stepping down.
*****
&gt; General Mills shares rose more than 2% after the company topped earnings and revenue forecasts for its most recent quarter.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the European Central Bank forum. Earnings from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, General Mills and McCormick are also on deck.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves followed steep losses for the major averages the day before. The Dow fell more than 1.5% on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 2% and 3%, respectively. The benchmarks all started the session with strong gains, but disappointing consumer confidence data halted those advances and sent stocks tumbling.
*****
&gt; “As long as the sell-off is orderly,” the Fed is “not concerned with the level of stock prices,” Guggenheim Partners’ Global CIO Scott Minerd told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “The bottom line is until we see some amount of panic here or something that gets the central bankers concerned, they are just ‘hellbent’ to get inflation under control.”

Two employees impacted by the layoffs told CNBC on Tuesday that they knew Tesla’s lease was approaching its end. The workers asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak on the matter.

1656556752,0,"Apologies for making yet another tesla post but I feel like this is worth discussing.

At the time of writing this post TSLA is worth $685.47 with a market cap of $710B. I don't own any shares of Tesla at all. 

My claim is that at this price and point in time the stock seems to be priced fairly and arguably is a pretty decent buy.  

My reasoning: 

1. Extreme growth: They have a 51% revenue CAGR starting with the realease of the model s in 2013 up until last year. This year they will probably have another 50% growth and &lt;&lt;probably&gt;&gt; another 50% in 2023. The point is that so far over the long run TSLA has grown extremely quickly and consistently. They will also have new models such as Semi, cybertruck and roadster arriving &lt;&lt;probably&gt;&gt; next year. AND they sell their cars with excellent margins. So their growth is very sustainable. 
2. Diverse and unique side businesses: As of this moment tesla gets the vast majority of its revenue and profit from selling cars, thats undeniable. But they have a lot of aspirations. Firstly, energy storage is going to be cruicial in transitioning the world to sustainable energy and tesla is at the forefront of this industry and are therefore in a prime position to capitalize on that. Secondly tesla is dabbling with insurance and juding by their lates report that business unit seems to be breaking even and soon will become profitable. It has only launched in a few states so far and there is a lot of room to grow. Solar shignles and solar in general is also another potential area for growth although tesla doesn't seem to be prioritizing it.  
3. Autonomy: Elon has many times over estimated his own timelines so this point is a little weak BUT if tesla does indeed manage to actually get FSD working properly (im guessing 2025 is the year where they start driving tens of thousands of kilometers without any issues) then tesla is poised to make a ridiculous amount of money. Since the vast majority of teslas by that time will have the hardware necessary to become autonomous, teslas will turn from depreciating cars to profit producing assets. This will have a massive effect on the whole auto industry and no doubt make tesla a lot of money. This is of course very risky but even if they have a 10% chance of pulling it off, id say its worth it. 
4. With all the infrastructure tesla is developing for AI, they could conceivably rent it out to other companies such as AWS but for AI training. Tesla hasn't spoken about this to my knowledge but once FSD is fully trained and has incredibly low failure rates, this would be a great use for all that hardware. 
5. Tesla bot? Similar to point 3 but 1% chance of succeeding. But again if they do succeed, trillions of dollars could be made. 

Potential issues: 

1. they need to fix vehicle quality and service. It doesn't seem to be a problem right now since demand is so much higher than supply but in the future it could become a problem. 
2. Elon should probably tweet less. 
3. There seems to be a massive minerals shortage (lithium) coming. Not sure how tesla will handle this but even if they do secure all the materials they need, their price will be extremely high. 

General thoughts:

With all of this being said tesla right now has a PE ratio of about 90. To give some context back in 2017-18 amazon had a similar PE while growing slower. They were already maxing out all their business lines. Tesla on the other hand is just getting started. They seems to have all the core technologies nailed and with a very solid roadmap ahead. So all in all, at this point in time, tesla seems to be a solid buy, just like amazon was 5 years ago, probably even better.  

Im curious to hear counter arguments to this. I keep seeing posts about how tesla is incredibly overpriced and that was true a year or two ago but imo not anymore.","apologies making yet another tesla post feel like worth discussing. time writing post tsla worth $685.47 market cap $710b. shares tesla all. claim price point time stock seems priced fairly arguably pretty decent buy. reasoning: 1. extreme growth: 51% revenue cagr starting realease model 2013 last year. year probably another 50% growth &lt;&lt;probably&gt;&gt; another 50% 2023. point far long run tsla grown extremely quickly consistently. also new models semi, cybertruck roadster arriving &lt;&lt;probably&gt;&gt; next year. sell cars excellent margins. growth sustainable. 2. diverse unique side businesses: moment tesla gets vast majority revenue profit selling cars, thats undeniable. lot aspirations. firstly, energy storage going cruicial transitioning world sustainable energy tesla forefront industry therefore prime position capitalize that. secondly tesla dabbling insurance juding lates report business unit seems breaking even soon become profitable. launched states far lot room grow. solar shignles solar general also another potential area growth although tesla seem prioritizing it. 3. autonomy: elon many times estimated timelines point little weak tesla indeed manage actually get fsd working properly (im guessing 2025 year start driving tens thousands kilometers without issues) tesla poised make ridiculous amount money. since vast majority teslas time hardware necessary become autonomous, teslas turn depreciating cars profit producing assets. massive effect whole auto industry doubt make tesla lot money. course risky even 10% chance pulling off, id say worth it. 4. infrastructure tesla developing ai, could conceivably rent companies aws ai training. tesla spoken knowledge fsd fully trained incredibly low failure rates, would great use hardware. 5. tesla bot? similar point 3 1% chance succeeding. succeed, trillions dollars could made. potential issues: 1. need fix vehicle quality service. seem problem right since demand much higher supply future could become problem. 2. elon probably tweet less. 3. seems massive minerals shortage (lithium) coming. sure tesla handle even secure materials need, price extremely high. general thoughts: said tesla right pe ratio 90. give context back 2017-18 amazon similar pe growing slower. already maxing business lines. tesla hand getting started. seems core technologies nailed solid roadmap ahead. all, point time, tesla seems solid buy, like amazon 5 years ago, probably even better. im curious hear counter arguments this. keep seeing posts tesla incredibly overpriced true year two ago imo anymore.","['PE', 'AWS', 'FSD', 'Tesla']"

*****

# [Stock futures fall more than 1% as S&amp;P 500 tracks for worst first half of the year since 1970](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures declined early on Thursday morning, as the S&amp;P 500 prepares to wrap its worst first half in decades.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 363 points, or 1.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 1.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures pulled back by 1.9%.
*****
&gt; Those losses came after home furnishings company RH issued a profit warning for the full year, Sweden’s central bank became the latest to hike rates. RH shares slipped more than 5% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; “The combination of slowing growth, fading EPS prospects, and ongoing monetary tightening has been weighing on equity sentiment for months and is causing consternation again this morning,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; Investors are also looking ahead to the release of new inflation data, with the core personal consumption expenditures index set to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET. That’s the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, and it’s expected to show a year-over-year increase of 4.8% for May, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was coming off a mixed session, with the Dow advancing 0.27% for its first positive day in three. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both posted a third straight negative day, declining 0.07% and 0.03%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on track for their worst three-month period since the first quarter of 2020 when Covid lockdowns sent stocks tumbling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down more than 20% over the last three months, its worst stretch since 2008.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is also on track for its worst first half of the year since 1970, as myriad factors pressure markets.
*****
&gt; “Surging inflation, the pivot in Fed policy, and historically pricey equity valuations were on the minds of investors as the year began,” noted John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; ″[T]he combination of COVID-19 lockdowns in China and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has escalated volatility further with investors becoming increasingly concerned about the possibility of [a] global recession sometime within the next year,” he added.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve has taken aggressive action to try and bring down rampant inflation, which has surged to a 40-year high.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester told CNBC that she supports a 75 basis point hike at the central bank’s upcoming July meeting if current economic conditions persist. Earlier in June, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, which was the largest increase since 1994.
*****
&gt; Some Wall Street watchers are worried that too-aggressive action will tip the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; “We do not believe the stock market has bottomed yet and we see further downside ahead. Investors should be holding elevated levels of cash right now,” said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.
*****
&gt; “We see the S&amp;P 500 bottoming at around 3,100, as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive, but necessary inflation-fighting measures are likely to depress corporate earnings and push stocks lower,” he added.
*****
&gt; All three major averages are on track to end June with losses. The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a third straight month of declines. The tech-heavy index has been hit especially hard as investors rotate out of growth-oriented areas of the market. Rising rates makes future profits — like those promised by growth companies — less attractive.
*****
&gt; The index is more than 30% below its Nov. 22 all-time high. Some of the largest technology companies have registered sizeable declines this year, with Netflix down 70%. Apple and Alphabet have each lost roughly 22%, while Facebook-parent Meta has slid 51%.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, weekly jobless claims will be in focus Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting 230,000 first-time filers. Personal income and spending data will also be released.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front Constellation Brands and Walgreens Boots Alliance will post quarterly updates before the opening bell, while Micron is on deck for after the market closes.

1656629174,79,"June 30 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is bracing for a leaner second half of the year, as it copes with macroeconomic pressures and data privacy hits to its ads business, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.

The company must ""prioritize more ruthlessly"" and ""operate leaner, meaner, better executing teams,"" Chief Product Officer Chris Cox wrote in the memo, which appeared on the company's internal discussion forum Workplace.

""I have to underscore that we are in serious times here and the headwinds are fierce. We need to execute flawlessly in an environment of slower growth, where teams should not expect vast influxes of new engineers and budgets,"" Cox wrote.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The memo is the latest rough forecast to come from Meta executives, who already moved to trim costs and pause hiring across much of the company this year in the face of slowing ad sales and user growth.

Tech companies across the board have scaled back their ambitions in anticipation of a possible U.S. recession, although the slide in stock price at Meta has been more severe than at competitors Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O).

The world's biggest social media company lost about half its market value this year, after Meta reported that daily active users on its flagship Facebook app had experienced a quarterly decline for the first time. 

Its austerity drive comes at a tricky time, coinciding with two major strategic pivots: one aimed at re-fashioning its social media products around ""discovery"" to beat back competition from short-video app TikTok, the other an expensive long-term bet on augmented and virtual reality technology.

In his memo, Cox said Meta would need to increase fivefold the number of graphic processing units (GPUs) in its data centers by the end of the year to support the ""discovery"" push, which requires extra computing power for artificial intelligence to surface popular posts from across Facebook and Instagram in users' feeds.

Interest in Meta's TikTok-style short video product Reels was growing quickly, said Cox, with users doubling the amount of time they were spending on Reels year over year, both in the United States and globally.

Some 80% of the growth since March came from Facebook, he added.

That user engagement with Reels could provide a key route to bolster the bottom line, making it important to boost ads in Reels ""as quickly as possible,"" he added.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors in April that executives viewed Reels as ""a major part of the discovery engine vision,"" but at the time described the short video shift as a ""short-term headwind"" that would increase revenue gradually as advertisers became more comfortable with the format.

Cox said Meta also saw possibilities for revenue growth in business messaging and in-app shopping tools, the latter of which, he added, could ""mitigate signal loss"" created by Apple-led privacy changes.

He said the company's hardware division was ""laser-focused"" on successfully launching its mixed-reality headset, code-named ""Cambria,"" in the second half of the year. Meta was also focused on linking accounts across its virtual reality products and traditional social media apps, he said.

Zuckerberg will share more on the company's priorities and outlook at the company's next Q&amp;A, he said. The weekly session is set to take place on Thursday.

1656651407,0,"    This is going to be short, but Gitlab is a platform for DevOps developers. Honestly if you want more service on their specific offerings which I already have looked into and don’t feel like listing, just look on their site but their goal is to help software developers from planning to implementing software. Their main competitors that offer aid in all steps are GitHub (bought by Microsoft), Jira from Atlassian, and Red Hat (bought by IBM). Though there are many more players in each steps where they are specialized, these 4 players are the main ones that cover all of the steps in software development aid.
	Over the past months, we have seen software companies with growth rates of 50%+ during the pandemic fall from their heights, but GTLB, which IPO’d at a price of 100 and reached a height of 130 before falling, is still at around 55. Though this is still a large drop, many other overpriced software companies have dropped significantly more. But besides peers, it is more important to look at historical valuation multiples. Gitlab is currently trading at 19.4x P/S ratio or a 17.2 EV/S ratio. Though the company is poised to grow roughly 60% in 2022 and 40%-50% in the years onward, it is still overpriced considering its negative income and cash flow. 
	They currently have an operating margin of -50% and even when excluding unusual items, the adjusted operating/Cash margin is roughly -25% and over the past 5 quarters, the operating margin has been constant showing no sign of improving margins in the near to mid future.
	
That was a lot of numbers so let me frame it in perspective, this business is growing at 50% at a near 20 P/S. Even if it was at max FCF margins of roughly 25-30% it would still be trading at around 75 times FCF. Though of course this high multiple has the exception due to 50%+ growth, Tesla is poised to grow at 50% over the next few years from guidance and  estimates yet it is…coincidentally trading at 75 FCF. Yes I know the automobile industry is vastly different and arguably more cyclical than the software business along with other downsides such as higher CapEx, but if a company with only 400 million in revenue and negative cash flow is being price similarly to an over 600 billion dollar company’s with soon close to $100 billion in revenues and actual cash flow, I would much rather buy the latter anyway of the week.

Besides Tesla as an example, TEAM (Atlassian) is trading at almost 65x 2022 FCF yet it is still growing 30% and its margins will continue to improve unlike GTLB’s.

To put it simply, why should one pay 75 times “imaginary” cash flow just because a business is growing 50% yearly.

Along with this, though the DevOps software market is large and growing fast at around 15% - 20% CAGR and more enterprises are adopting and integration better software, Gitlab has been used more by smaller teams which is why their Unit economics suck. They are neck and neck with Jira, GitHub, and Red-hat for the lucrative enterprise software deals. They have no competitive advantage and I believe they will soon lag behind their competitors in securing enterprise deals due to Microsofts, Atlassian, and IBM’s already well-established software’s integration making them much more favorable for enterprises.

I still have not done enough Due Diligence to feel comfortable in terms of understanding the market perfectly though I am mainly doing those for feedback.

Edit: Though I quickly mentioned that there are companies specialized in each step but that they don’t provide as many steps, these companies such as JFrog (which I’m a bull on) or Nexus are starting to expand from their core products into other parts of the pipeline definitely making the environment more competitive.","going short, gitlab platform devops developers. honestly want service specific offerings already looked don’t feel like listing, look site goal help software developers planning implementing software. main competitors offer aid steps github (bought microsoft), jira atlassian, red hat (bought ibm). though many players steps specialized, 4 players main ones cover steps software development aid. past months, seen software companies growth rates 50%+ pandemic fall heights, gtlb, ipo’d price 100 reached height 130 falling, still around 55. though still large drop, many overpriced software companies dropped significantly more. besides peers, important look historical valuation multiples. gitlab currently trading 19.4x p/s ratio 17.2 ev/s ratio. though company poised grow roughly 60% 2022 40%-50% years onward, still overpriced considering negative income cash flow. currently operating margin -50% even excluding unusual items, adjusted operating/cash margin roughly -25% past 5 quarters, operating margin constant showing sign improving margins near mid future. lot numbers let frame perspective, business growing 50% near 20 p/s. even max fcf margins roughly 25-30% would still trading around 75 times fcf. though course high multiple exception due 50%+ growth, tesla poised grow 50% next years guidance estimates yet is…coincidentally trading 75 fcf. yes know automobile industry vastly different arguably cyclical software business along downsides higher capex, company 400 million revenue negative cash flow price similarly 600 billion dollar company’s soon close $100 billion revenues actual cash flow, would much rather buy latter anyway week. besides tesla example, team (atlassian) trading almost 65x 2022 fcf yet still growing 30% margins continue improve unlike gtlb’s. put simply, one pay 75 times “imaginary” cash flow business growing 50% yearly. along this, though devops software market large growing fast around 15% - 20% cagr enterprises adopting integration better software, gitlab used smaller teams unit economics suck. neck neck jira, github, red-hat lucrative enterprise software deals. competitive advantage believe soon lag behind competitors securing enterprise deals due microsofts, atlassian, ibm’s already well-established software’s integration making much favorable enterprises. still done enough due diligence feel comfortable terms understanding market perfectly though mainly feedback. edit: though quickly mentioned companies specialized step don’t provide many steps, companies jfrog (which i’m bull on) nexus starting expand core products parts pipeline definitely making environment competitive.","['GitHub', 'Samsung Electronics', 'JFrog', 'IBM', 'GTLB’s', 'GTLB', 'FCF', 'Nexus', 'Gitlab', 'DevOps', 'Tesla', 'Apple', 'Microsoft']"

&gt; Shares of Kohl’s fell 16% premarket after it cut its outlook for the fiscal second quarter, citing softer consumer spending, and terminated talks to sell its business, saying the retail environment has deteriorated since the beginning of its bidding process.
*****
&gt; Thursday marked the end of the second quarter and the first half of the year. For the quarter, the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 16% – its biggest one-quarter fall since March 2020. For the first half, the broader market index dropped 20.6% for its largest first-half decline since 1970. It also tumbled into bear market territory, down more than 21% from a record high set early January.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite were not spared from the onslaught. The 30-stock Dow lost 11.3% in the second quarter, putting it down more than 15% for 2022. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, suffered its biggest quarterly drop since 2008, losing 22.4%. Those losses pushed the tech-heavy composite deep into bear market territory, down nearly 32% from an all-time high set in November. It’s also down 29.5% year to date.
*****
&gt; Those steep first-half and quarterly losses come as investors grapple with sky-high inflation and tighter monetary policy. The core personal consumption expenditures index – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 4.7% last month on a year-over-year basis. While that was slightly below a Dow Jones estimate, it was still near multidecade highs.
*****
&gt; The Fed, in turn, has stepped up its efforts against the surge in prices, hiking by 0.75 percentage point in June. That was its biggest rate increase since 1994.
*****
&gt; Both of these factors have resulted in escalating recession worries. First-quarter GDP contracted by 1.6%, and the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow tracker is pointing to another 1% decline in economic output for the second quarter.
*****
&gt; “If we have any words of comfort, it is that universal losses at this pace rarely take place in successive quarters, but this is not the same as saying that further losses should not be anticipated,” wrote Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management. “This still very much looks to be the middle of the story, the period in which a previously ‘pacific’ outlook is replaced by something far stormier, and we are yet to see any signs that the weather is about to turn for the better.”
*****
&gt; Traders will take in more economic data Friday, with the latest ISM manufacturing index and construction spending numbers set for release at 10 a.m. ET.

&gt; **Kohl’s (KSS)** – Kohl’s tumbled 17.9% in premarket trading after the retailer confirmed an earlier CNBC report that it ended talks to be bought by Vitamin Shoppe parent Franchise Group (FRG).

1656684693,9,"[full article](https://www.autonews.com/china/li-auto-hozon-sign-catls-new-620-mile-range-ev-battery)

 

Chinese **electric vehicle** startups Li Auto Inc. and Hozon New Energy Automobile Co. emerged as the first customers of a new long-range battery that Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. unveiled Thursday and plans to start mass producing in 2023.

The “Qilin” battery has a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) on one charge, energy density of up to 255 watt-hour per kilogram, and is safer and more durable than existing cells, according to CATL, as the world’s biggest maker of EV batteries is known. It is also 13 percent more powerful than one planned by Tesla Inc., a major customer of **CATL**.

The battery -- named after a Chinese mythical creature -- has the longest range offered by any mainstream manufacturer yet. It comes as CATL faces greater pressure to innovate and maintain its dominance, with rivals at home and abroad -- from BYD Co. and China Aviation Lithium Battery Co. to LG Energy Solution Ltd. and Panasonic Holdings Corp. -- developing their own products.

Li Auto’s founder and chairman, Li Xiang, used China’s microblogging platform Weibo to draw attention to a potential battery supply deal, sharing details of CATL’s Qilin and commenting: “See you next year.”

CATL responded: “Qilin has Li Auto.”

Beijing-based Li Auto, which trades in New York and Hong Kong, is due to launch its first pure EV model in 2023, following two models that use gasoline to power electric motors, including its latest -- the L9 luxury SUV -- that was unveiled this week, with deliveries to start in August.

Hozon also used Weibo to publicly link itself to the new battery.

CATL will also supply batteries to South Korea’s **Kia** Corp., though the type of cell is unknown. A CATL spokesman confirmed all three supplier deals Friday, without providing details.

A Kia spokesman declined to comment on CATL, saying only that the company is cooperating with various suppliers to “diversify and stabilize battery supply.”","( chinese **electric vehicle** startups li auto inc. hozon new energy automobile co. emerged first customers new long-range battery contemporary amperex technology co. unveiled thursday plans start mass producing 2023. “qilin” battery range 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) one charge, energy density 255 watt-hour per kilogram, safer durable existing cells, according catl, world’s biggest maker ev batteries known. also 13 percent powerful one planned tesla inc., major customer **catl**. battery -- named chinese mythical creature -- longest range offered mainstream manufacturer yet. comes catl faces greater pressure innovate maintain dominance, rivals home abroad -- byd co. china aviation lithium battery co. lg energy solution ltd. panasonic holdings corp. -- developing products. li auto’s founder chairman, li xiang, used china’s microblogging platform weibo draw attention potential battery supply deal, sharing details catl’s qilin commenting: “see next year.” catl responded: “qilin li auto.” beijing-based li auto, trades new york hong kong, due launch first pure ev model 2023, following two models use gasoline power electric motors, including latest -- l9 luxury suv -- unveiled week, deliveries start august. hozon also used weibo publicly link new battery. catl also supply batteries south korea’s **kia** corp., though type cell unknown. catl spokesman confirmed three supplier deals friday, without providing details. kia spokesman declined comment catl, saying company cooperating various suppliers “diversify stabilize battery supply.”","['Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.', 'China Aviation Lithium Battery Co.', 'CATL’s Qilin', 'Hozon New Energy Automobile Co.', 'CATL', 'LG Energy Solution Ltd.', 'Weibo', 'Li Auto Inc.', 'BYD Co.', 'Panasonic Holdings Corp.', 'Kia', 'Tesla', 'Li Auto']"

1656797104,28,"I like the posts about battered high-growth stocks and reliable stocks to hold with high inflation. But, I would like to get more attention with this post on stocks that are trying to transform to a new business model or due a turnaround. A few ideas I'm aware of:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Warner Bros Discovery**: Invest in WBD if you believe that they will successfully transition from a legacy TV to a streaming TV player and they'll realize all of the revenue &amp; cost synergies of combining Warner Bros &amp; Discovery together

&amp;#x200B;

* **any auto manufacturer not named Tesla**: Tesla has a 10 year headstart on electric vehicles so find a company that you believe can spend their capex efficiently &amp; effectively on CapEx technology and then can harvest those prior CapEx investments someday to be a profitable EV player. Ford, General Motores, and there are a couple more.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Netflix**: Invest in Netflix if you believe their transition from subscription video on demand to a hybrid option that includes cheaper advertising video on demand will help them lose fewer subscribers and continue growing revenue

&amp;#x200B;

* **Meta**: Invest in Meta if you think their metaverse bet will work out

&amp;#x200B;

* **Peloton**: Invest in Peloton if you think a new CEO and the restructuring moves will work out for a stock that has struggled ever since the economy reopened

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla delivered 254,695 electric vehicles globally in the second quarter, a nearly 18% drop from the previous period as supply chain constraints, China’s extended COVID-19 lockdown and challenges around opening factories in Berlin and Austin took their toll on the company. This is the first time in two years that Tesla deliveries, which were 310,048 in the first period this year, have fallen quarter over quarter. Tesla deliveries were up 26.5% from the second quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter reduction is in line with a broader supply chain problem in the industry. It also illustrates the importance of Tesla’s Shanghai factory to its business. Tesla shuttered its Shanghai factory multiple times in March due to rising COVID-19 cases that prompted a government shutdown.

The company said Saturday it produced 258,580 EVs, a 15% reduction from the previous quarter when it made 305,407 vehicles. Like in other quarters over the past two years, most of the produced and delivered vehicles were Model 3 and Model Ys. Only 16,411 of the produced vehicles were the older Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla said in its released that June 2022 was the highest vehicle production month in Tesla’s history.

Without further ado, here is the walk I am taking you on:

Amazon is a reliable stock because they are a mega cap trillion dollar company which demonstrates assurance that the company has several hundreds of billions of dollars to fund their operations during economic downturns such as the current bear market we are enduring. Further, long-term historical company success is not a indicator of future success but is a valid indicator of past success and demonstrates the company has overcome several bear markets including the 2001 dotcom bubble which Amazon of which Amazon is an E-commerce dotcom stock. Also, Amazon dwarves competition such as Wal-Mart and Target of which Amazon is at the front of E-commerce and as we saw major success during Covid-19 when restrictions were imposed nationwide, this company grew to produce outstanding returns it's competitors (if you will) could not compare to.

Amazon could very well potentially be a candidate constituent for the DJIA index which will grow the value and price of the stock considerably. I can't quantify relatively how much this would be, but there may be methods to estimation.

Amazon as stated above is the crowned leader in E-commerce, but is also the undisputed leader in cloud computing in which is has acquired over a 30% market share trailing ahead of several and many major companies. Further, Amazon has considerable revenue from other venues like it's own video streaming service which has gartered quite a customer base, and is geared up to compete with few on it's respective leader, rest assured, Amazon Streaming is not going to go away anytime soon, just like it's AWS cloud computing which is claimed to be a major success on the level of a trillion dollars itself.

Amazon is selling at a discount, due to the overall market. Amazon just conducted a 20-1 stock split which had proved successful for any short-term trader, but more than anything makes the company more affordable for the average investor, or anyone looking to get in on the opportunity to invest in the safe company which high prospects.

Finally, Amazon is having their company holiday shopping day event on July 12th-13th this year.

W￼arren Buffett-Backed BYD has overtaken Tesla to become the world’s biggest electric vehicle producer by sales, even as Covid lockdowns in China disrupted supply chains.
Shenzen-based BYD (ticker: 1211.Hong Kong) sold 641,000 new energy vehicles in the first half of 2022, the company said on July 3.  That represents an increase of almost 315% year-on-year in the same period last year. In June, BYD sold 134,036 new energy vehicles, a year-on-year increase of 162.7%.
“The performance looks impressive,” wrote Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung in a Monday report. He has the highest price target for BYD stock on the Street at 640 Hong Kong dollars a share, more than double the recent price of 313.60.  

By comparison, Tesla (TSLA) delivered almost 565,000 electric vehicles in the first half of the year. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered 254,695 EVs, a drop of 18% compared with first quarter deliveries of 310,048. But June was the highest vehicle production month in Tesla’s history, according to the company. 
New Energy Vehicles, or NEVs, in China include plug-in hybrid vehicle that have a internal combustion engine as well as a battery pack that can be charged using an external power source. BYD sells both plug-in hybrids as well as all battery-electric vehicle. Tesla only sells battery electric vehicles. 
Tesla still has the edge in battery-only cars, but BYD’s growth is accelerating.
BYD sold 314,638 plug-in hybrids in the first half of the year, up 454% compared the first half of 2021. BYD sold 323,519 battery electric vehicles in the first half of 2022, up 246% from the same period a year earlier. 
Tesla’s 564,753 vehicles sold worldwide in the first half of 2022 rose about 46% compared with the 386,050 vehicles delivered in the first half of 2021.

I am in the middle of reworking my portfolio to reduce fees and capitalize on the recent downturn in the markets. Right now I am pretty heavy on ETFs, including monthly dividend ETFs. However the fees are killing me, and I'm looking forward to saving some money.

I'd like to hear some input on the big players I'll be looking at:

\- GOOG

\- AMZN

\- COST

\- NKE

\- HLIT.TO

\- FIGS

Are there any big players that should be added that I'm missing?

1657108653,29,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Hump Day! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, July the 6th, 2022-

*****

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed after a late day rally and ahead of Fed minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. equities futures were little changed on Wednesday morning after the market staged a big midday reversal on Tuesday, with falling bond yields giving a boost to growth stocks, and ahead of a batch of economic data.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were close to the flatline. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were also about flat.
*****
&gt; In regular trading, the Dow lost 129 points to start the holiday-shortened week, trimming steeper losses from earlier in the session. The S&amp;P 500 rallied back from a 2% loss in the final hour of trading and finished the day up 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, jumping 1.75%.
*****
&gt; Whether the economy is about to fall into a recession continued to worry investors after the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell below the 2-year yield. The so-called yield curve inversion historically has been a warning sign that the economy may be falling or has already fallen into recession.
*****
&gt; Oil prices tumbled below $100 a barrel Tuesday, further reflecting a potential economic slowdown. Energy stocks were the top decliners Tuesday. The sector as a whole fell 4%. It was the top performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 for the first half of they year, the benchmark index’s worst first half since 1970.
*****
&gt; However, Wall Street analysts say a recession could be mild. On Tuesday Credit Suisse said it sees the U.S. dodging a recession as it slashed its year-end S&amp;P 500 target to reflect the effect of higher capital cost on stock valuations.
*****
&gt; ″[The market] has been bracing for [a recession], and now it may actually be embracing it, the idea being: let’s just get it over with, we’re going have a recession, let’s do it. Let’s clean out the excesses and start all over again,” said Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “The market starting to look ahead into next year and that could very well be a recovery year from whatever this recessionary environment turns out to be,” he added. “We’re all kind of doing a Hamlet recession – to be or not to be. I’m kind of thinking that there’s going to be a mild recession.”
*****
&gt; NewEdge Wealth chief investment officer Cameron Dawson echoed that sentiment.
*****
&gt; “Do we have a kind of drawdown that looks to be in that 30% range, which is the average for recessions, or something that looks closer to down 50%, which is what we saw back in the early 2000s and 2008 where we had two debt crises?” she said. “We don’t see a debt crisis. We think that we could start to find some value around that 3,400-3,500 level because that’s what gets us back to the pre-Covid highs.”
*****
&gt; There are no major earnings reports scheduled for Wednesday, but there will be a slew of economic reports coming out, including the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June meeting in the afternoon.
*****
&gt; Mortgage demand fell week over week even as rates declined, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The latest Markit and Institute for Supply Management manufacturing PMI data will be released at 9:45 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., respectively. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, will also be released at 10:00 a.m.

1657122197,0,"I see a lot of people make valuation arguments without discussing earnings and growth expectations. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models are famously used for valuation which is based on earnings and growth expectations. While there are several other models that are used, most if not all are also based on earnings and growth expectations. Therefore, you cannot make a legitimate argument without discussing these two factors. This isn't something I made up, it's based on the foundations of finance and historical findings of much smarter minds than me on stock valuation.

The most popular example we all see on the internet these days is ""Tesla is overvalued"". I'm not here to debate whether or not it is, but let's pause and actually investigate why Tesla is so highly valued as opposed to just calling it ""hype"".  Many arguments compare them to competitors along the lines of ""other automakers such as Ford and GM produce way more cars than Tesla"" or ""the competition is coming with EVs"", etc. While all these points are *true,* these arguments are still *incomplete* as they are not accounting for earnings and growth expectations. These arguments would make more sense if they were attributed to those two factors.

Let's investigate the revenues and profits of 2 of the most popular US automakers, GM and Ford, along with Tesla. *(Note that I have used operating income as opposed to net income to exclude the noise from Ford's Rivian position)*

We can clearly see that Tesla is growing exponentially while both Ford and GM have negative growth/stagnated  from 2016 to 2021. In fact, Tesla  already has higher earnings than Ford. Based on this historical information and management's projections of a 50% multi-year growth rate, it wouldn't be an unreasonable assumption to make that Tesla will overtake GM in earnings as well very soon. Institutional (and some retail) investors are discounting their own projected future cash flows for each of these companies to the current stock price. And for this reason of earnings and growth expectations, Tesla is valued exponentially higher than other automakers.","see lot people make valuation arguments without discussing earnings growth expectations. discounted cash flow (dcf) models famously used valuation based earnings growth expectations. several models used, also based earnings growth expectations. therefore, cannot make legitimate argument without discussing two factors. something made up, based foundations finance historical findings much smarter minds stock valuation. popular example see internet days ""tesla overvalued"". debate whether is, let's pause actually investigate tesla highly valued opposed calling ""hype"". many arguments compare competitors along lines ""other automakers ford gm produce way cars tesla"" ""the competition coming evs"", etc. points *true,* arguments still *incomplete* accounting earnings growth expectations. arguments would make sense attributed two factors. let's investigate revenues profits 2 popular us automakers, gm ford, along tesla. *(note used operating income opposed net income exclude noise ford's rivian position)* gm: ( ford: ( tesla: ( earnings ($) year 2016 2021: ||2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |gm|9.55b|8.66b|4.45b|5.48b|6.63b|9.32b| |ford|5.79b|4.88b|3.20b|574m|\-1.28b|4.52b| |tesla|\-0.68b|\-1.63b|\-0.39b|\-0.07b|1.99b|6.52b| earnings growth 2020 2021: ||2020|2021|$ growth|% growth| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |gm|6.63b|9.32b|\+2.69b|\+41%| |ford|\-1.28b|4.52b|\+4.96b|na (+)| |tesla|1.99b|6.52b|\+4.53b|\+228%| *na percent increases cannot calculated negative number positive.

1657221109,65,"Disney is one of the largest brands out there and the company has been seen as one with a moat for a very long time. 

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals and provide insights into the business fundamentals, financials as well as valuation. Feel free to disagree with the analysis and share your views. 

***Let's get started!***

&amp;#x200B;

**Share price performance &amp; dividends**

If we take a look at the last 5 years, the performance isn't great, down 7%, way below the S&amp;P500 performance. Up until mid-2020, the company was a dividend-payer, so if we take the dividends into account, the return would be close to -2%. As of mid-2020, due to the pandemic, they've decided to change their dividend policy and stop paying dividends. In case the company decides to go back to paying dividends, the yield would be somewhere around 2% (based on the current share price).

&amp;#x200B;

**The two main divisions**

The company is currently organized into two divisions and understanding each one is important before we can make any rational/informed assumptions about the future.

**Disney media &amp; entertainment distribution - Division #1**

This is their largest division contribution almost 70% of the total revenue. It grew from a bit over $30b in the financial year 2017\* to over $50b in the last twelve months ending March 2022.

*\*Disney's financial years end in September and start in October the year before.* 

However, in the same time, the operating margin of the division is down from 30% to 10%. To better understand that, we need to go one layer deeper. This division has three main segments

**a) Linear Networks** (ABC, Disney, ESPN, National Geographic, Star) with an average operating margin of 31% in the last 5 years

**b) Direct-to-consumer** (Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, Star+) with an average operating margin of -17% in the last 5 years

**c) Content sales/Licensing** (theatrical distribution, home entertainment (DVD/Blu-ray), Music distribution) with an average operating margin of 30% in the last 5 years

Now, we all know the streaming war going on with Netflix and Amazon Prime and Apple Plus TV, and Disney/Hulu. Direct-to-consumer stream is the reason behind the decrease in the operating margin of this segment. It has grown significantly in the last 4 years and since it has a negative operating margin, it brings down the margin of the entire division. Of course, the margin has been improving over time.

So, what can we expect from this division in the long run? The Linear Networks and the Content sales/licensing are both relatively mature segments with limited growth ahead, but high margins. The direct-to-consumer is high growth in terms of revenue, but the margin is yet to catch up. Looking into all the competitors, I don't see any chance that the operating margin gets anywhere close to the 30%. So in my forecast, I feel comfortable using a 25% long-term operating margin. What this means is I'm starting with the 10% and slowly increasing that over time.

**Disney parks, experiences, and products - Division #2**

This division contributes the remaining 30% of the revenue and it is related to the theme parks (Florida, California, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai), Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club, National geographic expeditions, Disney resort, and spa. Not only that, but here is also the revenue that Disney earns by licensing trade names, characters, visuals, and other IP to manufacturers, game developers, and publishers, as well as the sale of branded merchandise.

This is the division that got impacted significantly in 2020. The revenue went from $23b in 2017 to $26b in 2019 down to $17b in 2020 and $16.5b in 2021. Not only that, but the margins went down from 24-25% to under 3%.

As the world is going back to normal, this division is recovering as well, the LTM sales are almost $24b and the operating margin is at 22%. This amazing recovery in such a short period of time indicates the strong brand around the company.

**Historical financial performance**

If we look at the annual report, the combined financials are not equal to the sum of the two divisions. When looking into the individual divisions, what's not taken into account are the restructuring expenses that Disney had (over $5b in 2020 due to the pandemic) that are not allocated to any division to provide a better view and not distort the division's profitability. The same goes for the goodwill impairment and certain expenses that are related to the 21st Century Fox and Hulu acquisitions. 

The balance sheet doubled in size in the last 5 years (roughly from $100b to $200b) majority of that due to the acquisitions ($50b goodwill, $10b other intangible assets) and their investments in content assets (&gt;$20b)

On the other side of the balance sheet, it is quite clear how this was financed as there's a significant increase in debt of over $30b and there's a significant increase in the number of shares outstanding (from 1.5b to 1.8b).

&amp;#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value. The assumptions are listed below:

**Revenue growth:** 15% for the next 12 months, followed by 6% in the 4 years after that and declining over time to 2.91%. The analysts are forecasting roughly 23% for 2022 and 12% for 2023. However, as the last public data is up until Q1/2022 (which is half of the financial year 2022 for Disney), part of this growth is already in the financials and included in my starting point.

**Operating margin**: Looking into the various divisions, a long-term target of 25% seems reasonable. Of course, this is highly dependent on the recovery of the DPEP division (which is on track) and the profitability of their Direct-to-consumer segment. In my model, I'm expecting the margin to increase slowly over time, reaching 25% in 8 years.

**Discount rate**: Currently 8.37% (based on WACC) increasing to 9.64% over time (also due to the fact that the FED is raising the interest rate)

**Outcome**: $89.4 (Current share price $96.08)

\*Note: In the DCF calculation, the outstanding equity options and the minority interest are also taken into account.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions stated above, the revenue will grow by 78% to $138.1b in the next 10 years and the operating margin will reach 25%.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) changes based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Op. margin|23%|25%|27%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|70% ($132.0b)|$78.4|$87.0|$95.5|
|78% ($138.1b)|$80.5|$89.4|$98.3|
|110% ($163.1b)|$94.6|$105.0|$115.4|
|140% ($186.4b)|$106.7|$118.4|$130.2|

It is worth mentioning that historically, Disney has almost always traded at a premium over the intrinsic value as it is seen as a bit more safe investment due to the brand behind it.

Elon Musk's tumultuous $44 billion US bid to buy Twitter is on the verge of collapse after the Tesla CEO sent a letter to Twitter's board saying he is terminating the acquisition.

The chair of Twitter's board, Bret Taylor, tweeted Friday that the board is ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.""

Twitter could have pushed for a $1 billion US breakup fee Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight over the deal, which the company's board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.


The possible unraveling of the deal is just the latest twist in a saga between the world's richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms.

Much of the drama has played out on Twitter, with Musk — who has more than 95 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.

What Elon Musk's Twitter feed says about how he might run the company
On Friday, shares of Twitter fell five per cent to $36.81 US, well below the $54.20 US that Musk had offered to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5 per cent to $752.29 US.

In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk said Twitter has ""not complied with its contractual obligations"" surrounding the deal, namely giving Musk enough information to ""make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter's platform.""

Major shareholder

Musk's flirtation with buying Twitter appeared to begin in late March. That's when Twitter has said he contacted members of its board — including co-founder Jack Dorsey — and told them he was buying up shares of the company and interested in either joining the board, taking Twitter private or starting a competitor.

Then, on April 4, he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company's largest shareholder after acquiring a nine per cent stake worth about $3 billion US.

At first, Twitter offered Musk a seat on its board. But six days later, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted that Musk would not be joining the board after all. His bid to buy the company came together quickly after that.

Elon Musk’s Twitter deal prompts free speech debate

Calling himself a ""free speech absolutist,"" Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover deal is reigniting the debate around freedom of speech on social media platforms. Some fear that under Musk’s ownership, Twitter could be exploited as a platform to spread disinformation and monitor critics.
Musk had agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 US per share, inserting a ""420"" marijuana reference into his offer price.

He sold roughly $8.5 billion US worth of shares in Tesla to help fund the purchase, then strengthened his commitments of more than $7 billion US from a diverse group of investors including Silicon Valley heavy hitters like Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.

Elon Musk threatens to abandon bid to buy Twitter over fake account problem
Inside Twitter, Musk's offer was met with confusion and falling morale, especially after Musk publicly criticized one of Twitter's top lawyers involved in content-moderation decisions.

As Twitter executives prepared for the deal to move forward, the company instituted a hiring freeze, halted discretionary spending and fired two top managers. The San Francisco company has also been laying off staff, most recently part of its talent acquisition team.","tesla ceo cites enough information twitter 'fake spam accounts' spacex owner tesla ceo elon musk seen los angeles june 2019. musk sent letter twitter's board seeking terminate acquisition social media platform.

1657374993,0,"I see a lot of people on different financials forums(mainly wsb, of course) that think that Elon used Twitter as a bait to sell his TSLA shares. This does not make any sense for the following reasons:

1. Elon started acquiring Twitter stock, before he  sold large chunk of TSLA shares, which was done for tax purposes according to him.

 2. Elon acquired the largest portion of the capital needed for the acquisition of Twitter by getting loans against his shares and attracting numerous high-profile outside investors like Larry Ellison and the Qatar state investment fund. He did not need to actually sell his shares to raise money.

3. Buying a company like Twitter requires extensive research and the use of a lot of resources (mainly financial). This was probably planned at least a year in advance, so the great oracle Elon probably did not have the chance to perfectly time his TSLA selling to maximise his profits. 

4. Do you actually think that a guy who tweeted that the  TSLA share price is too high cares so much about his shareholders opinion, so he will orchestrate a very expensive and time consuming operation that could potentially greatly harm his public and business persona, just so he will have an excuse to sell his TSLA shares? Musk has stated numerous times that the sole purpose for his accumulation of wealth is to secure the funding for the dream of his life, which is making humans interplanetary species. Couldn't he just have said that he is going to sell a small portion of his TSLA holdings for that reason? 

5. No, TSLA stock probably would not have crashed even if he did not state any reason for the reduction of his stake in the company. It is not like he sold 50 percent. Also, have you seen how devoted are the teslabros? 

6. No, you won't be able to sue Elon, cuz your calls expired worthless. One of the main reasons why founders and investors make their company's public is because financials markets provide them with great liquidity. 

I obviously can't say for certain why Elon decided to back out of the deal. My personal opinion is that he probably just changed his mind  in part due to miner setbacks like the number of bots on the site. As we all know , he is not very stable as a person and it is probably not as deep as many people think it is.","see lot people different financials forums(mainly wsb, course) think elon used twitter bait sell tsla shares. make sense following reasons: 1. elon started acquiring twitter stock, sold large chunk tsla shares, done tax purposes according him. 2. elon acquired largest portion capital needed acquisition twitter getting loans shares attracting numerous high-profile outside investors like larry ellison qatar state investment fund. need actually sell shares raise money. 3. buying company like twitter requires extensive research use lot resources (mainly financial). probably planned least year advance, great oracle elon probably chance perfectly time tsla selling maximise profits. 4. actually think guy tweeted tsla share price high cares much shareholders opinion, orchestrate expensive time consuming operation could potentially greatly harm public business persona, excuse sell tsla shares? musk stated numerous times sole purpose accumulation wealth secure funding dream life, making humans interplanetary species. said going sell small portion tsla holdings reason? 5. no, tsla stock probably would crashed even state reason reduction stake company. like sold 50 percent. also, seen devoted teslabros? 6. no, able sue elon, cuz calls expired worthless. one main reasons founders investors make company's public financials markets provide great liquidity. obviously can't say certain elon decided back deal. personal opinion probably changed mind part due miner setbacks like number bots site. know , stable person probably deep many people think is.","['Elon', 'Tesla']"

There's a lot of bad information out there about this topic, so I thought I'd clear a few things up:

* Musk doesn't need permission from the Tesla board to sell shares.  He's subject to the same regulations other company insiders are subject to, and he's subject to a special agreement from 2018 with the SEC governing his Tweets, but he doesn't need the board to say ""yes"" in order for him to sell stock.
* Investors can sue Musk because they think his Tweets were fraudulent or deceptive or something else, but they can't sue him simply for selling shares he was legally permitted to sell.
* While it's true that company officers have a fiduciary obligation to support stock prices and maximize long-term shareholder value, this only applies to their actions in their role as company officer.  Their decision to sell their own shares is not part of that.  All stock sales put downward prices on shares, and think about how absurd it would be if no company officer could ever sell stock because it would put downward pressure on prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this is basic stuff, but it seems some people are confused on the basics here.

Maybe with someone that would streamline the business similar to Tim Cook and Steve Jobs.

I only ask this because I see a lot of sentiment around the investing subreddits that Elon might be more detrimental to the long term success of the company with his out going demeanor and contrarian ceo personality.

# [Stock futures tick higher with all eyes on June’s inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as investors awaited a key inflation report that is expected to show a fresh high.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 82 points, or 0.26%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.31%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.41%.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index, slated for at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to climb by 8.8% in June on a year-over-year basis, according to Dow Jones’ survey of economists. That would be even higher than May’s 8.6% reading, which was the biggest increase since 1981.
*****
&gt; “The market is anticipating that June will be the new peak,” said Lindsey Bell, Ally’s chief markets and money strategist. “The reading is likely to confirm what the jobs report on Friday told us – that the Fed will stick to their aggressive rate tightening timeline.”
*****
&gt; The likely hot reading could prompt the central bank to hike another 75 basis points during this month’s meeting. Last month, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5%-1.75% in its most aggressive hike since 1994.
*****
&gt; “The Fed’s credibility will be tested in coming months with the release of inflation numbers and corporate earnings,” said Andy Sparks, head of portfolio management research at MSCI. “The Fed’s recent aggressive actions to bring down inflation also run the risk of overshooting, pushing an economy that had been showing signs of weakness into a full scale recession.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, investors will monitor second-quarter corporate earnings as major banks are set to report this week. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are slated to post results Thursday before the bell. Delta Air Lines reports before the bell Wednesday.

1658058419,107,"Dropbox is a company that's been public for less than 4 years and the price today ($21.74) isn't that far from its IPO price of $21.

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals, provide insights about the key topics and value the company as a whole. The purpose is purely for education.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Dropbox?**

It is a cloud storage solution where content can be accessed from anywhere and shared with others. Today, with all the storage alternatives that we have and the progress that has been done in this field, well, it doesn't sound as revolutionary as it did 15 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**The key numbers**

As it is a subscription-based platform, the number of users plays a big role. This is what a lot of analysts pay attention to and although they look at the exact same numbers, they end up with different conclusions about the future of Dropbox.

\#1 - Registered users - Over 700m! - This is the first big number to focus on. This number is roughly 10% of the world population, so they are able to reach a lot of people.

\#2 - Paying users - 17m - Wait, is that a typo, that's only 2.5% of the total users. No, it is not a typo. Only 2.5% of the registered Dropbox users are actually paying users.

The question is, can they convert more users to become paying? Do you trust in their ability to do that? Here's when the analysts are clashing. On one side, the bulls are painting the picture of a future where the conversion is high, while the bears are asking the question where will this conversion start? This is a fair question as the users were there last year, the year before, and the year before...

&amp;#x200B;

**The financials**

The revenue formula is simple, **# of paying users** multiplied by the **average revenue per user**. Both of these numbers have been increasing and that reflects in the total revenue. The users, we already touched upon that earlier and it is clear that it depends on their ability to convert. The average revenue per user depends on their ability to either charge more for their existing service (which is tough, as their competitors are all giants - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) and their ability to create new product offerings (through R&amp;D or through acquisitions).

However, the growth of the revenue has been declining. From **19%** growth in 2019 to **15%** growth in 2020, to **13%** growth in 2021...

What about the pandemic? With the huge change from the traditional working environment to the remote/work-from-home, yet, surely the demand for this is surging. When I started analyzing Dropbox, I was expecting to see a surge in the revenue, so seeing that it isn't there, I was a bit disappointed.

As for the margins, they keep improving over time:

\- Gross margin improved from 72% in 2018 to 80% in 2021. The cost of service represents the expenses associated with the storage, delivery &amp; distribution of the platform/services, not only to the paying but also to the free users. so, free users burn some of Dropbox's cash.

All the operating expenses decreased as % of revenue between 2018 and 2021:

\- R&amp;D from 55% to 34%

\- Sales &amp; Marketing from 32% to 20%

\- G&amp;A from 20% to 20%

So the operating margin improved from -35% to 13%. Is there room to grow? Yes, absolutely. Based on the management's guidance, they can improve at least an additional 7% in the future, hence, the margin will be over 20%. On top of that, the investments that they make in the equipment cost them less than the historical amounts that they've paid, so the margin will increase even further over time.

&amp;#x200B;

**The key topic - the cash!**

One of the topics that you'll notice appearing most, especially around bull analysts is the free cash flow of the company and the expected increase in the coming years.

The free cash flow grew from $392m in 2019 to $491m in 2020, to $708m in 2021, and is expected to reach $1b in 2024!

The market cap today is roughly $8b. So, that's roughly 12.5% free cash flow yield (2024 is not that far, so I'm simplifying this). In theory, if Dropbox is not growing at all, and just pays the $1b out to the shareholders, that should bring a 12.5% return every single year, right? Well, not really.

We need to step back to better understand this. The free cash flow formula is quite simple:

Free cash flow = Operating cash flow - Capital expenditures

It represents **the cash that is free for the management** to decide what to do with it, whether that is buying back shares, paying it out as a dividend, acquiring a new company, or, well, just nothing yet.

As this is looking through the prism of cash and it doesn't take share-based compensation (it is not a cash movement) and it doesn't take acquisitions (Dropbox had 2 of them in the last 3 years, totaling over $300m) because that depends on management's decisions.

You might be wondering, well, isn't acquisition capital expenditure? It definitely falls in the same category, but free cash flow doesn't represent what's free to distribute to the shareholders. Again, it is the free cash flow left **for the management** to decide what to do with it.

If you notice, the free cash flows mentioned above are quite far from their operating result. The main reason is stock-based compensation, which is huge! It is roughly $300m/year. What does this mean?

Part of the employee compensation is not paid in cash, but in stock options/shares. This is not a cash expense, hence, looking through the cash lense, it just isn't there.

If Dropbox wants to maintain the number of shares outstanding, it would need to spend the $300m and buy back shares. Have they been doing that? Yes! The number of shares decreased by roughly 10% in the last 3 years. But it wasn't free, it cost them over $1.6b!

This is important to understand, so whenever we encounter free cash flow, we don't assume that's what is free for us as investors, because it isn't. The free cash flow for the investors is a lot lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the value of Dropbox. Below are my assumptions:

**- Revenue**: To increase 7% per year in the next 5 years, then slowly decline to 3%. - In line with the average analysts' expectation.

**- Operating margin:** To increase to 24% over the next 5 years.

**- Discount rate:** 6.7% to increase over time to 9.64% to reflect the environment that we're in today (with the FED increasing rates)

\- **Outcome:** $14.82/share

The DCF takes into account the $1.5b in cash and $2.4b debt that is on their balance sheet (As of Q1/2022) and the $650m equity options outstanding.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 75% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 24%. I could significantly be wrong in my assessment.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|22%|24%|26%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|50% ($3.3b)|$11.4|$12.7|$14.0|
|75% ($3.9b)|$13.3|$14.8|$16.3|
|120% ($4.9b)|$16.6|$18.4|$20.3|
|150% ($5.5b)|$18.2|$20.2|$22.2|

**My thoughts**

Dropbox is operating in a fairly competitive field and the fact that it couldn't significantly grow during the pandemic shows that the alternatives are more appealing.

The # of registered users is definitely a huge number, but unless they are monetized, it doesn't add value.. Can they convert a significant portion? Based on the historical data, there's not enough proof, hence I do not feel comfortable including that wishful thinking in my forecast.

I am looking forward to reading your views about the company and feel free to provide feedback regarding the analysis, that is always appreciated!","dropbox company that's public less 4 years price today ($21.74) far ipo price $21. goal post analyze company's fundamentals, provide insights key topics value company whole. purpose purely education. #x200b; **what dropbox?** cloud storage solution content accessed anywhere shared others. today, storage alternatives progress done field, well, sound revolutionary 15 years ago. #x200b; **the key numbers** subscription-based platform, number users plays big role. lot analysts pay attention although look exact numbers, end different conclusions future dropbox. \#1 - registered users - 700m! - first big number focus on. number roughly 10% world population, able reach lot people. \#2 - paying users - 17m - wait, typo, that's 2.5% total users. no, typo. 2.5% registered dropbox users actually paying users. question is, convert users become paying?

I have bought some FTEC and FXAIX ETFs during Feb 2020 and I have some gain from them.Both of these ETFs consists of Apple as the highest holding. I also have some Apple stock.

1658161319,0,"Basically my theory is that stock splits may be an indicator of a market decline. Or market sentiment about a market decline.

GME, GOOGL, TSLA, AMZN, SHOP being examples of companies that have or will likely split this year. Because realistically the optics are worse if a stock like GOOGL were to fall from $3000 to $1500 in a downturn than if the stock were to drop from $150 to $75 in a downturn following a split.

Tesla felt overpriced at $1,200 and so by splitting, the sting of a potential market downturn is taken away or certainly mitigated to a degree. In these scenarios you can claim there was a split rather than your stock cratered from $1,000+ and the impact *feels* lighter.

And so someone much smarter than me could probably get the data points together and I believe make a good case for a correlation between a high number of stock splits in a given year and the performance of the market overall in the following year. What do you think?

Do you guys know of an API (can be paid) which provides

1. Earnings estimates i.e. forecasted EPS consensus, # of estimates etc.,
2. Up to date quarterly earnings data submitted by the company

Surprisingly, I checked Alpha Vantage API for this but JPM earnings that were submitted last week aren't there (using free key). I checked free yfinance API and JPM quarterly earnings are there but only revenue and earnings. I'm checking now some paid options like EODHD but they seem to lack #1. Ugh. Quite new to coding.

# [Stock futures rise after Monday’s Dow reversal as a busy earnings week continues](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/18/stock-futures-are-flat-after-dow-reverses-course-to-start-busy-earnings-week.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as traders pored through more corporate earnings reports a day after the market failed to sustain a sharp rally.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 164 points, or 0.53%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked up 0.68%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.72%.
*****
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, although the pharmaceutical giant also cut its full-year revenue and profit guidance. Hasbro’s revenue for the previous quarter came in a tad below expectations, while the toymaker’s earnings per share beat a Refinitiv forecast.
*****
&gt; Netflix is set to report after the close Tuesday. Later in the week, Tesla, United Airlines, American Airlines, Snap, Twitter and Verizon are among those scheduled to report.
*****
&gt; IBM shares fell 5% in the premarket, after the tech company lowered its forecast for cash flow, even while reporting earnings that beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; So far, roughly 8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported calendar second-quarter earnings. Of those companies, about two-thirds have beaten analyst expectations, FactSet data shows.
*****
&gt; “When we think about earnings and we think about where stocks are now, we think there’s upside simply because there may be overpricing of this recession that some people think is imminent or already upon us,” said Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, during Monday’s Fast Money on CNBC.
*****
&gt; # Dow reversal
On Monday, the Dow shed more than 200 points to end the day in the red, reversing a morning rally fueled by solid earnings reports from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. Oil broke above $100 a barrel, and b/itcoin surged to the highest levels seen since mid-June.
*****
&gt; Late in Monday’s session, stocks were dragged down on a Bloomberg report that Apple would slow hiring and spending on growth next year to prepare for a potential economic downturn. Shares of the iPhone maker ended the day about 2.1% lower.
*****
&gt; The news came as traders weigh the potential for a U.S. recession, especially as inflation remains at multidecade highs and the Federal Reserve raises rates to curb said inflationary pressures.

1658242786,43,"Tesla Inc. is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell, with Wall Street worried it will be a “difficult” quarter for the electric-vehicle maker amid ongoing supply-chain snags and pandemic-related factory shutdowns. “We fully expect a difficult (second quarter), based on continuing supply-chain issues and factory shutdowns,” said Bill Selesky, an analyst with Argus Research.

Tesla TSLA, 0.55% earlier this month reported a quarter-on-quarter fall in deliveries, its proxy for sales, leading some analysts to cut their expectations for the EV maker’s quarter. But some of the issues facing Tesla are already accounted for in Wall Street estimates, and investors are aware, Selesky said. He said he expects Tesla to “modestly” beat expectations thanks to reduced costs and relatively strong margins.

Dan Levy at Credit Suisse said the “key question” for investors next week will be “the magnitude of margin pressure from the Shanghai shutdown” due to China’s “COVID zero” policies. Levy said he expects margin recovery in the second half of the year as “Tesla ramps on volume.”

**Here’s what to expect:**

**Earnings:** Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla to report adjusted earnings of $1.82 a share in the second quarter, which would compare with adjusted earnings of $1.45 a share in the second quarter of 2021. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, fund managers, company executives, academics and others, is expecting an adjusted profit of $2.05 a share for Tesla.

**Revenue:** The analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for sales of $16.54 billion for Tesla, which would compare with $12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Estimize is expecting $17.1 billion in revenue for the quarter.

1658252127,0,"Just finished watching the Hulu WeWork documentary, and throughout the entire film, all I could think was ""How is Tesla not just like WeWork??"" The parallels between the two are a lot in my opinion. 

Summarizing real quick and briefly the WeWork documentary:

- Adam shows up in 2010 after the financial crisis. This was a time when people were being a bit greedy, betting on Tech companies a lot of money in hopes of incredible returns or finding that next ""unicorn"". 
- Adam uses his charisma to ensnare people into working for him and investing in his dream, a ""revolution in the workplace"" that would ""forever change the human interaction"" when it comes to business and maybe even societal expectations about work / life balance. Telling people that everyone is a ""creator"" and all this other spiritual stuff. 
- WeWork had a fairly straightforward business model. The company would sign long-term leases on office space (from Adam after he purchased the buildings himself) subdivide it into smaller work areas, and then rent those out to freelancers or small businesses on a short-term basis. 
- The innovation here was the different way of presenting work space to people - changing the overall aesthetic. That is it!! 
- WeWork uses all types of tactics (gets attractive young people, booze, free snacks in offices, the inspirational mantras, etc...) to entice people to work for them or open their offices in WeWork locations, or invest in the company. Adam essentially creates a cult of personality around him, being all about “bringing people together” in the “spirit of We."" He cashed in the fact that many people are looking for ""purpose"" in life. 
- Adam Neumann insisted that WeWork was going to be huge, and it had something to do with technology. “So we’re definitely not a real-estate company,” he said to a skeptical television interviewer. “We are a community of creators” who “leverage technology to connect people. . . . And it’s a new way of working. Just like Uber is the sharing economy for cars, and Citibike for bicycles, we’re the sharing economy for space.” 
- With momentum on his side, Adam / WeWork expand at crazy levels and get crazy a valuation after investments from SoftBank.
- WeWork is bleeding money like crazy throughout the entire time, and the more they grow, the more cash they burn - who knew paying building mortages or leases would be so expensive when only half of the office space is being used?  Meanwhile, Adam and his wife keep pushing the cult of personality, now telling people that WeWork and the We Company will solve world hunger, education issues, and all these crazy things. 
- WeWork is in debt, and with SoftBank finally stopping all investments on the company, Adam Neuman is finally forced to try to take the company public in order to get more cash. The S1 goes terribly and they are forced to shelf the IPO due to the market's reaction - valuation dropped tremendously as investor lost confidence in the company. 


With all this in mind, I cannot see Tesla as anything else but a WeWork waiting to happen...

- Musk is another CEO who uses charisma in order to push the company to where he wants. Is he smarter than Adam, yes I would say in general he is smarter. However, Elon has been more and more in the media for negative reasons than good ones... The cult of personality around Elon has begun to erode finally and more people are starting to see him in a negative way. 
- Tesla keeps saying that they are a Tech company, not a Car Manufacturer. However, at the end of the day, that is what they are, a car manufacturer. They sell cars.... 
- Tesla keeps pushing the tech on their cars as a reason for why it should be though of as a Tech company, but car manufacturer companies like Ford, BMW, Chrysler, and other are already catching up in terms of the 'self-driving' capabilities and battery technology for electric cars. It would be like me calling Ford a Tech company now that they have the Mach E and the electric Ford F150... just not the case. 
- Tesla delivers less cars than any of the other car manufacturers, WAY LESS CARS... but somehow their valuation is higher than the top ten car manufacturers combined! How in the world???!?!?
- Tesla is getting sued by the government due to Musk misleading the public and investors about his AutoPilot technology - which doesn't exist yet really. 


In general, I see Tesla as the next WeWork. Tesla’s stock price is completely divorced from any kind of financial reality. If you look at the history of Tesla’s stock price, it was never based on car sales. It’s always been based on hype from Musk and a vision for a future. That vision was appealing to many, but as Musk's eccentricity keeps growing... I don't see this lasting a lot longer.

I know people love Tesla and Musk here, but","finished watching hulu wework documentary, throughout entire film, could think ""how tesla like wework??"" parallels two lot opinion. summarizing real quick briefly wework documentary: - adam shows 2010 financial crisis. time people bit greedy, betting tech companies lot money hopes incredible returns finding next ""unicorn"". - adam uses charisma ensnare people working investing dream, ""revolution workplace"" would ""forever change human interaction"" comes business maybe even societal expectations work / life balance. telling people everyone ""creator"" spiritual stuff. - wework fairly straightforward business model. company would sign long-term leases office space (from adam purchased buildings himself) subdivide smaller work areas, rent freelancers small businesses short-term basis. - innovation different way presenting work space people - changing overall aesthetic. it!! - wework uses types tactics (gets attractive young people, booze, free snacks offices, inspirational mantras, etc...) entice people work open offices wework locations, invest company. adam essentially creates cult personality around him, “bringing people together” “spirit we."" cashed fact many people looking ""purpose"" life. - adam neumann insisted wework going huge, something technology. “so we’re definitely real-estate company,” said skeptical television interviewer. “we community creators” “leverage technology connect people. . . . it’s new way working. like uber sharing economy cars, citibike bicycles, we’re sharing economy space.” - momentum side, adam / wework expand crazy levels get crazy valuation investments softbank. - wework bleeding money like crazy throughout entire time, grow, cash burn - knew paying building mortages leases would expensive half office space used? meanwhile, adam wife keep pushing cult personality, telling people wework company solve world hunger, education issues, crazy things. - wework debt, softbank finally stopping investments company, adam neuman finally forced try take company public order get cash. s1 goes terribly forced shelf ipo due market's reaction - valuation dropped tremendously investor lost confidence company. mind, cannot see tesla anything else wework waiting happen... - musk another ceo uses charisma order push company wants. smarter adam, yes would say general smarter. however, elon media negative reasons good ones... cult personality around elon begun erode finally people starting see negative way. - tesla keeps saying tech company, car manufacturer. however, end day, are, car manufacturer. sell cars.... - tesla keeps pushing tech cars reason though tech company, car manufacturer companies like ford, bmw, chrysler, already catching terms 'self-driving' capabilities battery technology electric cars. would like calling ford tech company mach e electric ford f150... case. - tesla delivers less cars car manufacturers, way less cars... somehow valuation higher top ten car manufacturers combined! world???!?!? - tesla getting sued government due musk misleading public investors autopilot technology - exist yet really. general, see tesla next wework. tesla’s stock price completely divorced kind financial reality. look history tesla’s stock price, never based car sales. it’s always based hype musk vision future. vision appealing many, musk's eccentricity keeps growing... see lasting lot longer. know people love tesla musk here,","['Lowe’s Companies', 'Adam / WeWork', 'SoftBank', 'Elon', 'Tech', 'BMW', 'Ford', 'Chrysler', 'Tesla', 'IPO', 'AutoPilot']"

1658347837,402,"&gt; Earnings per share (EPS): $2.27 (adjusted) vs $1.81 expected, according to Refinitiv

&gt; Revenue: $16.93 billion, vs. $17.1 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

&gt; Early this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 254,695 electric cars for the period ending June 30, 2022, showing 27% growth from the year-ago quarter, but an 18% decrease sequentially. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales Tesla discloses. Its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 93% of those deliveries.

&gt; Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and Covid outbreaks in China exacerbated ongoing semiconductor and parts shortages, along with other supply chain snags. Covid restrictions in Shanghai forced Tesla to temporarily suspend or limit production at its factory there during the second quarter of 2022.

&gt; CEO Elon Musk also lamented the high costs of starting up production at new factories in Austin, Texas and Grünheide in Brandenburg, Germany. During an interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a company-recognized fan club, Musk said the two new factories “are gigantic money furnaces.”

&gt; The CEO announced steep headcount cuts in June.

&gt; Tesla’s cryptocurrency holdings also likely declined in value substantially, depending on how the company traded them. Barclay’s analyst Brian Johnson said on Monday that he expects Tesla to record an impairment of up to roughly $460 million due to bitcoin declines. 

&gt; On the brighter side, Tesla recently marked a milestone with an employee posting on LinkedIn this week that the company surpassed production of 2 million vehicles at its Fremont, California factory.

&gt; According to a White House memo from June 28, Tesla also plans to “begin production of new Supercharger equipment that will enable non-Tesla EV drivers in North America to use Tesla Superchargers.”

1658353264,1687,"Tesla seems to be abandoning its ten-figure bitcoin bet amid a severe slump in cryptocurrency markets. 

The electric-car maker said on Wednesday that it has sold approximately 75% of its bitcoin as of June 30. It said it converted $936 million worth of the cryptocurrency into fiat between April and June. 

Tesla made waves — and sent the price of bitcoin skyrocketing — when it announced a $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency in February 2021. A company of Tesla's stature placing such a big bet on the burgeoning and volatile crypto market was unprecedented. Tesla held onto much of its stake as bitcoin soared to new heights by the end of 2021.

But the value of bitcoin has plummeted since amid a wider economic downturn. The currency has lost more than 50% of its value this year and took another sharp dive on Wednesday afternoon following Tesla's announcement. 

Elon Musk's automaker said it still holds $218 million worth of the digital currency. It justified its initial purchase by saying that it was looking into liquid assets that had more upside than cash. 

Tesla said it made $272 million on bitcoin sales early last year. Add that to the $936 million it offloaded this quarter and the $218 million it still held at the end of the quarter, and Tesla comes out roughly $74 million in the red on its bitcoin bet.

1658396937,3,"As with anything Tesla, I'm seeing lots of comments containing false information getting upvotes, saying they ""bought high and sold low"" or made a big loss on their Bitcoin. I just wanted to clarify that this is not the case:

Tesla sold 10% of their total BTC in March 2021 as a liquidity test at a profit (~$100M as per their 10Q). Then they sold 75% of their remaining BTC this quarter in May, at around the same price they bought it for. On the EC they mentioned they made a slight profit, but it was offset by their impairment.

As for that, the way BTC accounting works is that you are not allowed to recognise any profits until you sell. So if you buy at $10k and BTC goes to $100k, the profit in your books is $0. Once you sell, you are allowed to recognise that profit.

On the other hand, if it drops below your ""carrying value"", you do need to recognise that impairment. So if you bought for $10k and it drops to $5k, you need to take a $5k loss on your earnings. If after that it goes back to $10k, you're still ""carrying"" it for $5k until you sell. You're not allowed to recoup your losses in the books until you sell. If at any point it goes below the lowest it's been while you were holding it (so $5k in this example), you again need to take an impairment in your books. As a result, Tesla had to mark down their carrying value in Q3 2021 as BTC dropped to ~$30K, which was their carrying value until Q2 and right around where they sold.

So in short, they made a small profit on the 75% they sold this quarter, but because the other 25% dropped roughly 35% below their carrying value (to $17,760), generating a ~$115M impairment (again, can just calculate this based on the earnings report), that offset the gains from the other 75%. Overall, they're still up roughly $100M from their first sale and another $60M from the remaining 25% because BTC is now ~30% higher than their carrying value.

**Tl;dr: Tesla's net gains on BTC (realised + unrealised) is ~$160M.**","anything tesla, seeing lots comments containing false information getting upvotes, saying ""bought high sold low"" made big loss bitcoin. wanted clarify case: tesla sold 10% total btc march 2021 liquidity test profit (~$100m per 10q). sold 75% remaining btc quarter may, around price bought for. ec mentioned made slight profit, offset impairment. that, way btc accounting works allowed recognise profits sell. buy $10k btc goes $100k, profit books $0. sell, allowed recognise profit. hand, drops ""carrying value"", need recognise impairment. bought $10k drops $5k, need take $5k loss earnings. goes back $10k, still ""carrying"" $5k sell. allowed recoup losses books sell. point goes lowest holding (so $5k example), need take impairment books. result, tesla mark carrying value q3 2021 btc dropped ~$30k, carrying value q2 right around sold. short, made small profit 75% sold quarter, 25% dropped roughly 35% carrying value (to $17,760), generating ~$115m impairment (again, calculate based earnings report), offset gains 75%. overall, still roughly $100m first sale another $60m remaining 25% btc ~30% higher carrying value. **tl;dr: tesla's net gains btc (realised + unrealised) ~$160m.**","['BTC', 'EC', 'Tesla']"

1658416784,8,"I posted this to the r/swingtrading, because I'm and idiot who tries to surf the waves rather than listening to Uncle Warren B. and hodling. But I'd like to post it here as well because I think the longer term potential outweighs the more precise timing of a swing.  

I think that this company is worth a couple of percent of the portfolio as a strategic investment for several reasons. I believe that once their is a bit of a real world track record for the VX4, we will see rapid adoption of these as emergency medical transport, and as replacement for police helicopters. Local governments in urban and suburban areas nationwide deal with regular complaints by their constituents about low flying police chopper noise, especially at night. Once proven reliable in real world settings, the potential uses will spring up faster than mushrooms after a rainstorm.

I've  been looking at this company for a bit, and took a small position  yesterday, after I read that American Airlines just ordered 50 of them  with potential follow up orders of 300 more.

I went to their site and took a look at the model in question:

Now,  tell me that plane isn't cool, and that platinum or diamond flyers  won't avail themselves the opportunity to skip the crush near baggage  claim and airport traffic to get a ride home. I think products like  these cannot help but capture the public imagination.

Looking  at these kinds of electric vehicles from whatever company 10 years from  now, I can envision pads being leased in commercial parking lots or the  like where density prevents landing directly at the destination. But  shuttling executives to rooftop helipads? No problem.

They  may not be exactly what was promised in The Jetsons yet, but they're  getting closer. By the time density becomes a problem, AI issues such as  Tesla is experiencing will have long before been worked out.

1658483094,4,"Tesla rallied 10% yeterday, post earnings. A move we have not seen in a while. Tesla long held the mantle of poster boy in the US 2020/21 tech rally, fanned my the biggest monetary expansion in history. Does its rally herald a comeback in tech, or is it one last dead cat bounce for the most over-hyped and over-priced stock in history?

To be fair to Tesla, there was some mis-reporting of Free Cash Flows being negative without its BitCoin sales. Not true (FCF = Operating Cash Flows - Cap-Ex), so the $621 million free cash flow was true, the BTC sale an investment cash flow. That said, the $0.8 billion reported net change in cash would have been negative without the BTC sale - which of course saw some loss of credibility to Musk given previous comments on the subject.

Perhaps a better understanding of the motivation for that decision on cash by its CEO and CFO can be helped by seeing the fall in free cash flows:

3Q21: $1,328M, 4Q21: $2,775M, 1Q22: $2,228, 2Q22: $621 

On a quarterly and trailing 12 month basis, Tesla announced:

**Revenues of $16.93 billion ($67.166 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Net (GAAP) profits of $2.259 billion ($9.516 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Free Cash Flow of $621 million ($6.952 billion, 12 month ttv)**

Tesla trades then at:

**13 x Price to sales;**

**89 x Price to earnings;**

**122 x Price to FCF**

Heady numbers, but Tesla is of course a growth stock and all about its future earnings potential in EV cars, semis, pick-ups, robo-taxis, business to business/customer tech sales, battery sales and artificial intelligence. Lets take a look at those areas vs its competitors...

China and Europe's large automobile markets (26 and 12 million sales in 2021) now have 1 in 5 cars sold as plug-ins (BEV/PHEV's) unlike the US mkt still showing only 1 in 20 EV sales from the 15 million vehicles sold in 2021. Tesla of course dominates US EV sales. It no longer does global markets outside of the US. BYD is now the leading global seller of EV's for those investors not paying attention (yes that includes hybrids, but increasingly dominated by BEV's):

[https://techstory.in/byd-overtakes-tesla-in-china-vehicle-sales-in-the-first-half-of-2022/](https://techstory.in/byd-overtakes-tesla-in-china-vehicle-sales-in-the-first-half-of-2022/)

Whilst Tesla still tops individual BEV model lists, its sales are only really across two models now (S and X sales very slight). VW group (presently trading at a measely $85 billion market cap vs Tesla's $845 despite selling 8.6 million cars in 2021) for example produces over a dozen EV models across Audi (e-tron; e-tron Sportback; e-tron GT), Man (electric semis), Porsche (Taycan), Seat (Cupra Born), Skoda (Enyaq/Enyaq Coupe) and VW (ID3; ID4; ID5; e-up; e-golf) brands.

Tesla was surpassed in EV sales by company in 2021 in China and Europe and has now been globally in 2022 It is no wonder with the sheer numbers and quality of alternative models of EV's on sale outside of US markets, for example in China the Xpeng P7 has proven a fierce rival to Tesla (particularly models coming with LIDAR) along with the BYD Han, essentially both mid-range luxury sedans, the equivalents of a Tesla Model S, for the price of a Model 3.

 Whilst Tesla kept Cap Ex to almost maintenance levels in 2020 to help become cash flow positive, Xpeng aggressively ploughs cash inflows into R&amp;D. Hence Xpeng now offers far superior hardware including LIDAR in its self drive hardware/software package, for a lot less money:

#[Nasdaq futures slide as Snap results weigh on technology stocks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news-.html)

*****
&gt; Nasdaq futures fell Friday as investors digested a fresh batch of corporate earnings that included disappointing results from Snap, which sent social media shares reeling.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 traded 0.3% lower, while S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 42 points, or 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Those moves follow what has been a strong week for markets, fueled by a rally in tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite is on course to close out the week 5.3% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track for a 2.4% weekly gain, while the S&amp;P 500 is set for a 3.5% gain.
*****
&gt; Shares of Snap plummeted a whopping 28% in extended trading after the Snapchat parent posted second-quarter results that fell short of analysts’ expectations and noted that it plans to slow hiring. The report was followed by a slew of analyst downgrades on the stock.
*****
&gt; The results from Snap weighed on other social media and technology stocks investors feared could get impacted by slowing online advertising sales. Shares of Meta Platforms and Pinterest fell 4.4% and 6.3% in the premarket, respectively, while Twitter and Alphabet each lost more than 2%.
*****
&gt; The Invesco QQQ Trust slid 0.58% after hours.
*****
&gt; Nearly 21% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings so far. Of those, 70% have beaten analyst expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The news could ruin what has been a hot streak for tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite posted its third straight positive session on Thursday. That came on the back of positive quarterly results from Tesla, which popped nearly 10% on Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq finished the regular trading day Thursday 1.36% higher to close at 12,059.61, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.99% to 3,998.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 162.06 points, or 0.51%, to settle at 32,036.90.
*****
&gt; Shares of growth-focused technology companies jumped in trading on Thursday as the dollar cooled down from its surge. The European Central Bank hiked rates by 50 basis points in its first increase in 11 years while initial jobless claims hit their highest level since November 2021.
*****
&gt; “This is showing you that market expectations are really low, that a little bit of good news can go a long way when you have low expectations,” said Truist’s Keith Lerner, noting that investors rotated back into growth stocks even amid this weak economic data.

# **Markets face what could be the most important week of summer with Fed, earnings and economic data - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/markets-face-what-could-be-the-most-important-week-of-summer-with-fed-earnings-and-economic-data.html)**
*****
&gt; There’s a head-spinning amount of news for markets to navigate in the week ahead, the biggest of which will be the Federal Reserve’s midweek meeting.
*****
&gt; The two largest U.S. companies — Microsoft and Apple — report Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Google parent Alphabet releases results Tuesday, and Amazon reports Thursday. Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, reports Wednesday. In all, more than a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies are reporting.
*****
&gt; On top of that are several hefty economic reports, which should add fuel to the debate on whether the economy is heading toward, or is already in, a recession.
*****
&gt; “Next week, I think, is going to be the most important week of the summer between the economic reports coming out, with respect to GDP, the employment cost index and the Fed meeting — and the 175 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; Second-quarter gross domestic product is expected Thursday. The Fed’s preferred personal consumption expenditures inflation data comes out Friday morning, as does the employment cost index. Home prices and new home sales are reported Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think what those bigger companies say about the outlook will be more important than the earnings they post. ... When you combine that with the statistical reports, which will be backward looking, I think it’s going to be a volatile and important week,” Grohowski said.
*****
&gt; The run-up to the Fed’s meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday has already proven to be dramatic, with traders at one point convinced a full point rate hike was coming. But Fed officials pushed back on that view, and economists widely expect a second three-quarter point hike to follow the one last month.
*****
&gt; “Obviously a 75 basis point hike is baked in the cake for next week,” said Grohowski. “I think the question is what happens in September. If the Fed is continuing to stay too tight for too long, we will need to increase our probability of recession, which currently stands at 60% over the next 12 months.” A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s rate hiking is the most aggressive in decades, and the July meeting comes as investors are trying to determine whether the central bank’s tighter policies have already or will trigger a recession. That makes the economic reports in the week ahead all the more important.
*****
&gt; # GDP report
&gt; Topping the list is that second-quarter GDP, expected to be negative by many forecasters. A contraction would be the second in a row on top of the 1.6% decline in the first quarter. Two negative quarters in a row, when confirming declines in other data, is viewed as the sign of a recession.
*****
&gt; The widely watched Atlanta Fed GDP Now was tracking at a decline of 1.6% for the second quarter. According to Dow Jones, a consensus forecast of economists expects a 0.3% increase.
*****
&gt; “Who knows? We could get a back-of-the-envelope recession with the next GDP report. There’s a 50/50 chance the GDP report is negative,” Grohowski said. “It’s the simple definition of two down quarters in a row.” He added, however, that would not mean an official recession would be declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which considers a number of factors.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, expects to see a decline of 1.9%, but added it is not yet a recession because unemployment would need to rise as well, by as much as a half percent.
*****
&gt; “That’s two negative quarters in a row, and a lot of people are going to say ‘recession, recession, recession,’ but it’s not a recession yet,” she said. “The consumer slowed quite a bit during the quarter. Trade remains a huge problem and inventories were drained instead of built. What’s interesting is those inventories were drained without a lot of discounting. My suspicion is inventories were ordered at even higher prices.”
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week with a 2.6% gain, and the Nasdaq was up 3.3% as earnings bolstered sentiment.
*****
&gt; “We’re really shifting gears in terms of what’s going to be important next week versus this week,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “We really had an economic data that was largely ignored. Next week, it will probably equal the attention we pay to the household names that are reporting.”
*****
&gt; # Better-than-expected earnings?
&gt; Companies continued to surprise on the upside in the past week, with 75.5% of the S&amp;P 500 earnings better than expected, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Even more impressive is that the growth rate of earnings for the second quarter continued to grow.
*****
&gt; As of Friday morning, S&amp;P 500 earnings were expected to grow by 6.2%, based on actual reports and estimates, up from 5.6% a week earlier.
*****
&gt; “We have kind of a perfect storm of inputs, pretty deep economic reports across the board, with things that have become important, like consumer confidence and new home sales,” said Hogan “For me, the real tell will be whether the attitude of investors continues to be that the earnings season is better than feared.”
*****
&gt; While stocks gained in the past week, bond yields continued to slide, as traders worried about the potential for recession. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.76% Friday, after weaker PMIs in Europe and the U.S. sent a chilling warning on the economy. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; “I do think the market is pivoting,” said Grohowski. “I do think our concerns at least are quickly shifting from persistent inflation to concerns over recession.”
*****
&gt; The potential for volatility is high, with markets focused on the Fed, earnings and recession worries. Fed Chair Jerome Powell could also create some waves, if he is more hawkish than expected.
*****
&gt; “There are a lot of signs out there about slowing economic growth that will bring down inflation. Hopefully, the Fed doesn’t stay too tight for too long,” said Grohowski. “The chance of a policy error by the Fed continues to increase because we continue to get signs of a rapidly cooling — not just cooling — economy.”

&gt; # August is the worst DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1988

&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 34 years, 1988-2021 with average declines ranging from –0.3% by Russell 2000 to –0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b075626ea3874e2fc116db33a8761fd5/0055cd9c0de3cf55-22/s500x750/15499d85ea532121b439c6e81fa8a9943d381a24.jpg))**

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1988; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998, with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2654ca71d08f8fd0df6b99fb95d9b9a2/0055cd9c0de3cf55-b6/s400x600/43a701788e7e1289967b0870c0c5c46b873c75d6.jpg))**

&gt; In midterm years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve slightly: #8 DJIA and S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1974), #5 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1982). Average losses range from –0.2% for S&amp;P 500 to –1.3% for Russell 2000. Russell 1000 has advanced 0.2% on average in midterm Augusts. All five indexes having winning track records, but losses have frequently been substantially larger than gains. DJIA and NASDAQ suffered double-digit losses in 1974, 1990 and 1998.

&gt; # Third Longest Streak of Negative Bull-Bear Spread on Record

&gt; Last week, over a quarter of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reported bullish sentiment for the first time in over a month. As the S&amp;P 500 has made a considerable move to the upside, bulls have continued to come back this week rising to 29.6%. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic has now come back within one standard deviation of its historical average and is at the highest level since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment has fallen in lockstep with the increase in bullish sentiment. After coming in at over 50% two weeks ago, the reading has shed 10.6 percentage points. Albeit improved, bearish sentiment remains well above the historical average and the double-digit two-week decline is actually the seventh of the year. In other words, the sharp drop in bearish sentiment is not exactly unusual compared to other moves this year as it still has further to go until it reaches a more ""normal"" level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Regardless, with inverse moves in bulls and bears the bull-bear spread has risen to -12.6. That is the highest reading since the first week of June and, as shown in the second chart below, the 16th consecutive week with bears outnumbering bulls. Clearing two other streaks from the early 2000s, that is now the third longest streak on record behind the 22 and 34-week-long streaks ending in December 1990 and October 2020, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-Streak.png))**

&gt; Not all of the losses to bears went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rose this week rising to 28.2% from 26.6% last week. That is the highest level in three weeks as neutral sentiment has generally been less volatile than bulls and bears recently.

&gt; # Declines Abound in Mortgage Data

&gt; Roughly one month ago, the national average for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage peaked above 6%. Since then, the rate has pulled back and stabilized around 5.75% in the past several weeks. Although mortgage rates have stabilized a bit, they remain at some of the highest levels since 2008 and have been heading marginally higher in the past week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-30y.png))**

&gt; Given the slight rise in rates, demand for mortgages continues to predict further weakness in upcoming home sales data as we noted in today's Morning Lineup. The MBA's Mortgage Purchase index released this morning came in at a slightly lower reading than the June 3rd low for the weakest reading in the index since March and April of 2020. This week's low is also below the range from the few years prior to the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-Purch.png))**

&gt; Not only has there been a lower volume of mortgages being applied for, but the actual dollar value of those loans has also plummeted amidst higher rates. As shown below, the average value of purchases reached a high of $460K back in March after a big increase in the first few months of this year. Since then, it has entirely reversed that move with the average value of loans having fallen all the way back down to $406K. That echoes the findings in other recent housing data which has similarly shown declines in home prices.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-Value.png))**

&gt; Higher rates have had an even more significant impact on refinance activity. Following another drop this week, the MBA's index tracking refinancings has now reached the lowest level since November 2000.

&gt; # Speculators Head for the Hills

&gt; As we do each Monday in our Closer report, we reviewed the latest data from Friday's release of the CFTC's Commitments of Traders (CoT) Report. This data shows how speculators are positioned in various assets based on positions in the various futures contracts. One asset that has seen some of the most notable changes of the report in recent weeks has been the S&amp;P 500. As recently as one month ago, that data showed a net 1.29% of open interest was positioned long. Even though the S&amp;P 500 has managed to come off the lows in the past month, positioning has collapsed with a massive move lower meaning there are far more speculators positioned short than long.

&gt; Whereas one month ago the reading was net long, in the latest data as of last Tuesday a net 9.3% of open interest was short. That made for the lowest reading since October 2015. In other words, speculators are positioned more pessimistically now than they were during the COVID crash, during the late 2018 near bear market, or any other time over the past several years. The change in positioning has also been rapid. As shown in the second chart below, that net positioning reading has fallen over 10 percentage points in just 4 weeks. Earlier this year in March there was an even larger 12.5 percentage point decline but prior to that, looking back through the history of this data, such large moves have been much rarer over the past decade than was the case in the 2000s and before. In fact, prior to this year the last time positioning in S&amp;P 500 futures fell double digits in four weeks was all the way back in August 2011. On the other hand, the early 2000s frequently saw moves of this size if not larger.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071922-COT-SP.png))**

&gt; Typically, sentiment data is considered contrarian in nature. In other words, pessimistic sentiment readings are followed by stronger forward performance of equities and vice versa. That has not exactly been the case for this CoT positioning data. Following past declines of at least 10 percentage points, returns have been mixed.

&gt; After declines of similar magnitude, the S&amp;P 500 has experienced modest outperformance over the next week. One and three months out, however, have tended to be weaker with postive returns only half the time with negative returns on an average basis. Over the next month, each of the past four instances have been followed by declines.

&gt; Six and twelve months out have seen the S&amp;P 500 higher two-thirds of the time, but average and median returns are not significantly better relative to all periods.

&gt; # More Small-cap weakness likely as Russell 2000 enters historically weakest part of year

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8fd703b64f2ab0d42bb9b829b105a769/3ff497f2b81cc1bf-69/s500x750/97c22df40bbed926529f6e903d4037d7b7431a50.jpg))**

&gt; In the above chart, 43 years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large caps are outperforming smaller companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. Small-caps have historically peaked versus large-caps in late-May to early June and tend to underperform until sometime in the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Best Performers Since Mid-June Low

&gt; Since June 16th, the market has reversed course higher, making the date at least a near-term bottom. From a technical perspective, the Russell 1000 broke through its 50-day moving average yesterday and broke above its upper downtrend line today. The 50-DMA is still moving lower, but this is the first time that the Russell 1000 has been above the 50-DMA since April 20th. However, the index is still 9.7% below its 200-DMA. These moves come as commodity prices have pulled back and earnings season begins.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/Russell-1000-Index-Chart-072022.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted in a Chart of the Day earlier this week, the lagging sectors during bear market declines tend to be the leaders in bear market rallies, which is holding true in the bounce since 6/16. The table below shows the 20 best performing stocks in the Russell 1000 Index since the 6/16 low. As you can see, these stocks are all still down considerably on a YTD basis, declining a median of 50.1%. However, these stocks have rebounded by a median of 42.1% since the low on 6/16. Only one of these stocks is below its 50-DMA, and only two are above their respective 200-DMA. If you think that the bear market has concluded, these would be some of the names worth looking deeper into.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/R1000-Stocks-Best-Since-616-072022.png))**

&gt; On the other hand, the best performing sectors during bear market declines tend to be the worst performing sectors during bear market rallies. Of the 20 worst performing Russell 1000 stocks since 6/16, 14 belong to the energy sector (which has been the best sector on a YTD basis by a wide margin). On a median basis, these 20 stocks are still up 13.6% on a YTD basis, but they've shed 13.7% of their value since the market bottomed in mid June. Notably, these stocks (on a median basis) are closer to their 200-DMAs than they are to their 50-DMAs. If you think that we are currently in a bear market rally that is bound to reverse course, these names would be worth looking deeper into.

1658616763,1245,"If this is true, then Apple is about to make a crap-ton of money. Some points from the [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/apple-carplay-could-be-a-trojan-horse-into-the-automotive-industry.html) where I found this stat:

* Apple engineering manager Emily Schubert said 98% of new cars in the U.S. come with CarPlay installed. She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.

* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.

* GM, which wasn’t listed on Apple’s slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. 

* Tesla, which doesn’t support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its “FSD” driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.

* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple’s software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.

* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car’s cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.

This sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:

* iPhone obviously.
* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.
* Apple home IOT networks.
* Apple's own entertainment content from Apple TV. I would not be surprised if Apple starts a movie studio 5 years from now or form some exclusive partnerships with maybe Disney.

While this is all exciting, that 79% sounds very inflated. For those of you looking to buy new cars, is having CarPlay really that big of a criteria when you consider your next vehicle?

If you want a shorter version, here is a nice [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-amazon-meta-highlight-tech-heavy-earnings-week-11658568602?mod=hp_lead_pos5). They note:

&gt; A little more than one-third of S&amp;P 500, or 175 companies, are scheduled to report earnings in the coming week, according to FactSet. [...]

&gt; So far, around 20% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings for their recently ended quarter, according to FactSet. Results have been mostly underwhelming, with the number of companies reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those surprises trending below their five-year average. Overall, earnings are on track to rise 4.8% this period, which would mark the slowest rate since the end of 2020, and revenue for the period is on track to grow 10.9%, FactSet said.

So the reason she apparently chose Nvidia is they are going to pass a multi billion dollar bill and she thinks the price is going to go up but NVidia is down 4% within the day alone unless it will go up within a week or two. 

This is where the confusion comes into play. Her choices for options, everything she put is going the opposite direction of what she has in play. If I'm looking at her two purchase options correctly she thinks apple and Microsoft are all going to be majorly lower than what the average price is by 2023? What information does she have that we don't. She thinks apple is going to be 80$ when its 150$ right now. She bet like 500k at least on those strike prices. Still new to trading but this is what I have for her trades. Would love to know what you all think.

# [Stock futures gain ahead of a busy week of earnings, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Monday morning, coming off a positive week for the major averages, as traders brace for the busiest week of corporate earnings, as well as insights into further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 173 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.5% each as well.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the major averages fell on the back of weaker-than-expected earnings from Snap that sent tech shares tumbling. Still, all three benchmarks closed the week higher, with the Dow up 2%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced about 2.6%, and the Nasdaq capped the week up 3.3%.
*****
&gt; It was the second positive week in the last three for the major averages. The S&amp;P 500 has been attempting a comeback after falling into a bear market earlier this year. The index is currently up more than 8% from its 2022 and trading near the highest levels since early June.
*****
&gt; Investors shifted into risk assets last week after absorbing some strong corporate results that had Wall Street deliberating whether the bear market has found a bottom.
*****
&gt; “Equities have managed to stage a rally MTD, and climb a wall of worry. The bounce has been led by cyclical and Growth stocks, helped by longer end yields stabilizing, which in turn eases the pressure on P/E’s,” Barclays’ Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.
*****
&gt; “This confirms to us that the market’s focus has switched from inflation worries to growth worries, with a sense that bad news is becoming good news again,” Cau added.
*****
&gt; As of Friday, about 21% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 reported earnings. Of those, nearly 70% beat analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Investors will face a stacked week of earnings ahead that will include reports from major tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will also conclude its two-day policy meeting. Economists are widely expecting a three-quarter point hike.

1658824803,492,"Just five companies control nearly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index’s market cap, and they will all report earnings this week that could determine the direction of the market for weeks or months to come.

As Big Tech — Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% — prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch’s Jon Swartz reported.

Amazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the “worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that “people are going to freak out.”

Any big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group’s earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.

This year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens — Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.

# [Stock futures fall after Walmart cuts forecast, says inflation hit consumer spending](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; A late Monday announcement from Walmart, which cut its quarterly and full-year profit estimates because of rising food inflation, alarmed investors who deliberated the implications for other retail stocks. The big-box retailer said higher prices are spurring consumers to pull back on general merchandise spending, particularly in apparel.
*****
&gt; Walmart plunged 9% in early morning trading and dragged other retailers with it. Target dropped 5.2%, and Amazon fell 3.7%. Kohl’s and Dollar General lost 4.5% and 3.6%, respectively, while Costco shed 3.1%.
*****
&gt; “Clearly, they have the wrong stuff, and they have to sell it more aggressively to clear that out, which looks like it’s going to take a pretty dramatic hit as a result of that,” Jeremy Bryan, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, said during CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “The question is, how does this relate to the rest of the discretionary space?” Bryan added.
*****
&gt; General Motors fell 3.6% in premarket trading after the company missed earnings estimates, citing supply chain disruptions stemming from Russia’s war on Ukraine and global Covid lockdowns.
*****

*****
&gt; Shares of McDonald’s eked traded just above the flat line in early trading following mixed second-quarter results, in which net sales were hurt in part by the closure of locations in Russia and Ukraine, but international growth elsewhere fueled a rise same-store sales.
*****
&gt; General Electric, UPS and 3M also reported strong quarterly earnings Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are bracing for an onslaught of mega-cap tech earnings and economic data this week, as well as the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting, that will help Wall Street direct its expectations for the rest of the year.
*****
&gt; “I think that there’s going to be a bifurcated market,” VantageRock Capital’s Avery Sheffield said during CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “I think the bottom might be in certain stocks, but nowhere in others. So this actually could be one of the most dynamic earnings seasons we’ve seen in a long time.”
*****
&gt; Stocks traded in a narrow range during Monday’s session, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 90.75 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lagged, sliding 0.4%. All of the major averages are on track for their best month of the year.

1658847627,0,"Technology stocks have been on a tear recently. Traders looking to catch the rally should look to the stocks that have just begun breaking out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 11% from its lowest close of the year in mid-June. That beats the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 8% gain since its mid-June low. Much of what is driving tech’s gains has been related to interest rates. Markets see a higher likelihood that inflation has peaked, and that the Federal Reserve will soon slow down the pace of interest-rate increases. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has slipped since mid-June. Lower bond yields make future profits more valuable—and many fast-growing tech companies are valued on the basis that they’ll churn out a chunk of their profits many years in the future. 

**Netflix (NFLX)** is a good example. The stock is up about 31% from its June low. At $218 a share, it’s now above its 50-day moving average of $187. That signifies that market participants are now willing to buy the stock at levels above a longer-term trend. That signals increased confidence in the stock’s outlook. It’s not just lower bond yields juicing the stock. Netflix’s earnings last week revealed fewer subscriber losses than analysts had anticipated, while management said it expects subscriber growth in the current quarter. Analysts are also predicting the company will rely less on upping its spending to accrue new subscribers and grow revenue, which will allow profit margins to expand. Earnings per share are expected to compound at annual rate of about 15% for the next three years, according to FactSet. 

**Spotify (SPOT)** is another example of a tech stock that is starting to break out. It has climbed about 20% from its 2022 low hit in mid-May. At $108, it’s above its 50-day moving average of about $105. Plus, buyers have frequently stepped in this year in the low-$90 area, to bring the stock upward. John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, wrote that the stock could have easily hit a “double bottom” in the low-$90 area. Spotify’s earnings are due out Wednesday. That will be a key catalyst keeping the stock trading at healthy levels, or it could send the price tumbling again. 

**Amazon.com** **(AMZN)** stock is also looking better. It has jumped about18% from its June bottom and, at $121, it is above its 50-day moving average of $113. A “bullish breakout” is in play if the stock can continue upward, Kolovos wrote.  Earnings for the e-commerce giant are coming Thursday. This all may sound rosy, but there is plenty ahead that could complicate tech stocks’ upward trajectory. Tuesday’s trading is evidence of that: The Nasdaq slid more than 1% after Walmart’s (WMT\_ earnings warning dented broader market sentiment. In addition, many tech companies report earnings in the next few weeks, and the Fed’s next interest-rate decision on Wednesday will be key for both the bond and stock markets. Meanwhile, all three of these tech stocks are still trading below their 200-day moving averages. In order for anyone to become even more bullish on these names, surpassing those levels will be key.

1658856717,159,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/coinbase-shares-tumble-after-report-that-its-facing-sec-probe.html

Shares of Coinbase dropped more than 15% Tuesday on reports that it’s facing an SEC probe into whether the platform is offering unregistered securities. Coinbase stock has lost more than 77% of its value this year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing whether the company illegitimately let users trade digital assets that haven’t been registered as securities, CNBC has confirmed with a source. The news was earlier reported by Bloomberg. “I’m happy to say it again and again: we are confident that our rigorous diligence process — a process the SEC has already reviewed — keeps securities off our platform,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal on Twitter. “We look forward to engaging with the SEC on the matter.”

This SEC probe reportedly happened before and was separate from Coinbase’s alleged insider trading scheme that led to the fraud charges against an ex-Coinbase product manager and two other people Thursday. But SEC also filed a complaint the same day, claiming that nine of the 25 tokens allegedly traded in the scheme were securities. The argument over how to classify cryptocurrency tokens is controversial. Generally speaking, if cryptocurrencies are commodities (like other kinds of currency), they would governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But many crypto projects are funded by the sale of tokens whose primary value is speculative. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that “many of these underlying tokens have the attributes of securities” and need to be regulated as such to protect investors.

In the agency’s recent lawsuit against the alleged insider trading scheme, the SEC wrote, “A digital token or crypto asset is a crypto asset security if it meets the definition of a security, which the Securities Act defines to include ‘investment contract,’ i.e., if it constitutes an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.” Other crypto firms, such as San Francisco-based Ripple, are also fighting lawsuits from SEC.","shares coinbase dropped 15% tuesday reports it’s facing sec probe whether platform offering unregistered securities. coinbase stock lost 77% value year. u.s. securities exchange commission scrutinizing whether company illegitimately let users trade digital assets haven’t registered securities, cnbc confirmed source. news earlier reported bloomberg. “i’m happy say again: confident rigorous diligence process — process sec already reviewed — keeps securities platform,” said coinbase’s chief legal officer paul grewal twitter. “we look forward engaging sec matter.” sec probe reportedly happened separate coinbase’s alleged insider trading scheme led fraud charges ex-coinbase product manager two people thursday. sec also filed complaint day, claiming nine 25 tokens allegedly traded scheme securities. argument classify cryptocurrency tokens controversial. generally speaking, cryptocurrencies commodities (like kinds currency), would governed commodity futures trading commission. many crypto projects funded sale tokens whose primary value speculative. sec chair gary gensler said “many underlying tokens attributes securities” need regulated protect investors. agency’s recent lawsuit alleged insider trading scheme, sec wrote, “a digital token crypto asset crypto asset security meets definition security, securities act defines include ‘investment contract,’ i.e., constitutes investment money, common enterprise, reasonable expectation profit derived efforts others.” crypto firms, san francisco-based ripple, also fighting lawsuits sec.","['Bloomberg', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/coinbase-shares-tumble-after-report-that-its-facing-sec-probe.html\n\nShares', 'The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission', 'the Commodity Futures Trading Commission', 'CNBC', 'Apple', 'Coinbase']"
1658898738,13,"7.6% drop on WalMart today, off 10.04 for a gap of slightly under 10 points. Interestingly, this represents the second large down gap WMT has made since May. How long it will take to recover remains to be seen, but the point I’d like to bring up is that the bottom line of the news is that WMT is having to further discount prices because merchandise is not selling. 

If people are not shopping at their rollback mega-stores that dot the land, what does that say about American consumer confidence and the financial reserves of the typical WMT shopper? They’re apparently not shopping at AMZN, as they gapped down 5% today or Target, down 3.1%, also a gap.

Food banks across America are facing surging demands according to CNN. Is that a further indicator that the recession is already lapping at our heels? 

The CCI as reported today showed a drop in confidence of 2.7 points to 95.7. Still pretty high compared to a bit over 25% during the Great Recession, but by no means a positive economic number. Also, it’s the third consecutive drop in the CCI.

The silver lining? 

If inflationary pressures &gt; less shopping &gt; price cuts and price cuts = lower corporate profits, then the resulting reaction is deflationary pressure on the market. Oil, gas, lumber and housing prices are all dropping.

 If the Fed is less aggressive in tone tomorrow, they’ll be looking at data like this and the CCI drop today rather than signaling the next hike.

So, if the market reacts favorably to the FOMC news, then I expect WMT to have a bounce through Friday. If the market’s down, then the chart tea leaves I read suggest 117.75-ish as the next support.

Finally, those tea leaves I was just reading? Well, they were apparently laced with peyote, so no one should take any of my views with any seriousness. This is NFA.

1658952553,221,"Meta reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results:

Earnings: $2.46 per share vs. $2.59 per share, according to Refinitiv
Revenue: $28.82 billion vs. $28.94 billion, according to Refinitiv
Meta shares have lost about half their value since the beginning of the year, underscoring investor concern about the health of the company’s core online advertising business. That unit has been hurt by Apple’s iOS privacy update last year, limiting Meta’s ability to track users, and by a weakening economy that’s led some companies to slash their ad budgets.

Analysts expect Meta to report its first ever year-over-year revenue decline, with sales projected to slip 0.5%. While the rest of the year isn’t expected to be as bad as the second quarter, analysts are still forecasting tepid growth of 5.6% for 2022 for a company that’s never had annual growth shy of 20% in its 10 years as a public company.

Meta could be the beneficiary of low expectations.

Last week, Snap and Twitter reported disappointing second-quarter results, and executives cited economic and mobile platform challenges that have permeated the online ad market. The mood soured so much that shares of Alphabet and Microsoft rose on Wednesday even though both companies missed analysts’ estimates on the top and bottom lines.

Microsoft said “reductions in advertising spend” in the quarter resulted in more than a $100 million loss in its online ad business that powers products like LinkedIn and Bing search. At Alphabet, YouTube’s growth slowed to below 5% from a year earlier, and CFO Ruth Porat said advertisers are pulling back due to “uncertainty about a number of factors.”

For Meta, the story goes well beyond the economy.

Instagram is coming under increased pressure from short video app TikTok. Meta has responded by pushing Instagram’s Reels feature, which algorithmically surfaces short videos to users.

That shift has come under scrutiny, including from celebrity sisters Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian, who criticized the app’s new direction this week. Instagram head Adam Mosseri indirectly responded by saying in a video shared on Twitter that Meta is working to improve the app. While photos will continue playing a major role, he said “more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time,” because of changing user habits that favor video.    

Meanwhile, Meta continues to spend billions of dollars a quarter on the metaverse, a digital world that can be accessed via virtual reality and augmented reality devices. The company’s Reality Labs unit, which is developing the metaverse, lost $2.96 billion in the first quarter.

Earlier this week, Meta raised the price of its Quest 2 VR headset by $100, citing rising production and shipping costs. Although Meta is currently the leader in selling VR headsets, that market is still tiny compared to mobile advertising.

Executives will discuss the results with analysts on a webcast starting at 5:00 p.m. ET.","meta reported earnings bell. results: earnings: $2.46 per share vs. $2.59 per share, according refinitiv revenue: $28.82 billion vs. $28.94 billion, according refinitiv meta shares lost half value since beginning year, underscoring investor concern health company’s core online advertising business. unit hurt apple’s ios privacy update last year, limiting meta’s ability track users, weakening economy that’s led companies slash ad budgets. analysts expect meta report first ever year-over-year revenue decline, sales projected slip 0.5%. rest year isn’t expected bad second quarter, analysts still forecasting tepid growth 5.6% 2022 company that’s never annual growth shy 20% 10 years public company. meta could beneficiary low expectations. last week, snap twitter reported disappointing second-quarter results, executives cited economic mobile platform challenges permeated online ad market. mood soured much shares alphabet microsoft rose wednesday even though companies missed analysts’ estimates top bottom lines. microsoft said “reductions advertising spend” quarter resulted $100 million loss online ad business powers products like linkedin bing search. alphabet, youtube’s growth slowed 5% year earlier, cfo ruth porat said advertisers pulling back due “uncertainty number factors.” meta, story goes well beyond economy. instagram coming increased pressure short video app tiktok. meta responded pushing instagram’s reels feature, algorithmically surfaces short videos users. shift come scrutiny, including celebrity sisters kylie jenner kim kardashian, criticized app’s new direction week. instagram head adam mosseri indirectly responded saying video shared twitter meta working improve app. photos continue playing major role, said “more instagram going become video time,” changing user habits favor video. meanwhile, meta continues spend billions dollars quarter metaverse, digital world accessed via virtual reality augmented reality devices. company’s reality labs unit, developing metaverse, lost $2.96 billion first quarter. earlier week, meta raised price quest 2 vr headset $100, citing rising production shipping costs. although meta currently leader selling vr headsets, market still tiny compared mobile advertising. executives discuss results analysts webcast starting 5:00 p.m. et.","['TikTok', 'Instagram’s Reels', 'YouTube', 'LinkedIn', 'Refinitiv\nMeta', 'Instagram', 'Meta', 'Apple', 'SAP SE', 'Alphabet', 'Microsoft']"
1658956930,21,"Are earnings for this quarter behaving like we are in a recession? My take is the 'earnings compression' if it does happen will have to be postponed to Q3 instead of Q2, by which points inflation will really cool down (based on crashing commodity prices, falling gas prices, tightening real estate, food crisis being overblown). So far, we are not seeing changes in the earning denominator sufficient to really increase P/E ratios dramatically. These are obviously cherry-picked, but I tried to add as many examples and statements as I could. If the consumer really were so weak, you wouldn't see so many contrarian statements from major banks, restaurant chains, auto makers, credit card processors, etc. GDP/inflation numbers are very aggregative metrics, so let's dive into what the actual companies are reporting.

I will not link to where many of these quotes come from due to time and this not being an academic paper, but I took most of them from the news articles in Bloomberg/CNBC/Seeking Alpha and can be googled for verification.


**Big Banks**: 

- JPM expects credit losses to remain abnormally low through much of 2023, because customers haven’t yet drained cash balances that grew fatter during the pandemic, executives said Monday. “Big picture, the near-term credit outlook, especially for the U.S. consumer, remains strong,” said CFO Jeremy Barnum. 
- C: ""Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight.
- BAC: ""Our U.S. consumer clients remained resilient with continued strong deposit balances and spending levels,"" said CEO Brian Moynihan. Earlier this month, BofA said credit and debit card spending rose 11% in June.

**Restaurants/Food:**

- Chipotle/MCD report weakening demand from lower income consumers, but overall strong sales beats. In MCD, they see more substitution from fancier restaurants to MCD, and for Chipotle, they already cater to a slightly richer crowd.
- Major beat from KO. “We continue to see resilience and a lot of demand not just in the U.S. but across the world,” Coke Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said. Consumers who missed experiences such as dining out and entertainment during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic are willing to spend more now, Coke Chief Executive James Quincey said. Executives said the company is preparing for consumers’ purchasing power to come under increasing pressure in the second half of the year.

**Credit Card:** 

- Visa reporting strong consumer and lots of travel. ""Consumers are back on the road, visiting various corners of the world, resulting in cross-border travel volume surpassing 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began in early 2020,"" said Chairman and CEO Alfred F. Kelly, Jr."" 

**Auto:**

- GM wrote ""“I would say that at the end of the day, all the data that we’ve seen to date on vehicle pricing and demand remains strong…we still think that there is a big pocket of demand that hasn’t been met yet.""  Tuesday, GM said it expects to make more money in the second half of the year. 
- F expects earnings to triple
- Mercedes: said it expects demand for its vehicles to outstrip supply for the rest of the year.

**Travel:**

- Hilton sees strong growth: The hotel industry has benefited from people spending on travel as well as hotel stays, though rising interest rates and tight financial conditions are stoking fears of a recession. However, credit card and other data indicate that travel demand is likely to remain robust.

**Software/tech:**

- MSFT with such strong guidance it brought the whole market up after its earnings. Azure grew 40% quarter over quarter, a very slight slowdown.
- Spotify eclipsed forecasts and added 6mn subscribers to its service in the second quarter, defying the slowdown at Netflix that has weighed on the music company’s stock price. The company ended June with 188mn subscribers, beating its guidance for 187mn. Total users — which includes those who do not pay — also beat expectations, rising to 433mn.
- JPM on Google after earnings: ""Our primary takeaway is that search’s demand is persistent even in a tough macro advertising environment given its consistent and high ROI while benefiting from its diversification across online and offline as well as across verticals and geographies""

1658964027,74,"I know the saying “markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent”, I have to say that’s never rang truer than this bear market but curious from a bull’s perspective - what is bullish? 

Many bulls are betting on a pivot toward the beginning of next year once a recession becomes evident. For two years it was constantly repeated to “not bet against the Fed” and now Bulls are doing exactly that. They have no clue if the Fed is going to back off at the end of this year, in fact Powell isn’t signaling he is going to at all. To me it appears they are just hoping they do. With the bond market holding at approximately 2.7%, the Fed only has to hike one more time and basically be done. I don’t foresee 2.7% to hold as further inflation readings come out. 

But let’s say he does pivot - how does that benefit the economy? There’s no way the rate hikes that have been implemented are doing enough damage to inflation to suggest that QE would be a good idea next year. If they lowered rates only a year after starting, that would just further lead to a stagflationary environment where consumers will continue to be priced out of everything - leading to another inevitable inflationary recession or the prolonging of the one we are entering. It would be a bandaid on  a much bigger wound that needs adequate medicine - a hardcore high unemployment recession. 

Without high unemployment inflation can not go down. It’s simply not possible. They need to push people out of work in order to conduct true demand destruction. We have started seeing hiring freezes and slight layoffs in certain companies, but nothing in terms of the magnitude to adequately conduct demand destruction. I firmly believe Powell won’t back off until he sees higher unemployment. He consistently repeats that the labor market is strong and is suggesting we aren’t going into a recession, so if that’s true how is that bullish? If anything he’s stating how strong things are and it gives him even more of a reason to hike. He reiterates the same thing over and over - we have a strong labor market. 

So to me we get two options: either a Fed that hikes into a recession and high unemployment and he meets his goal of demand destruction to tackle inflation or he pivots and further contributes to higher inflation and leads to a recession anyway. I am a bull long term, but the current times mimic the depression. The roaring 20s were due to QE after the war (this time COVID), unchecked speculative investing and inflation, and a behind the curve Fed that started tightening into a recession.  Earnings also haven’t been looking great, with big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta missing. Apple is up tomorrow as well and I anticipate a miss, especially after seeing Walmart’s atrocious miss.

# [Stock futures fall slightly after big Fed rally, Meta shares decline](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures moved lower Thursday after markets staged a major rally in the previous session following another 0.75 percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 47 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures lost 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Meta Platforms dipped 5.9% in premarket trading on the back of disappointing quarterly results, while Ford gained more than 5% after a beat on the top and bottom lines, and as it raised its dividend. Teladoc cratered more than 25% after taking another large goodwill charge.
*****
&gt; The moves come on the heels of a broad-based rally Wednesday after the Fed’s latest monetary policy decision, as investors continued to bet on whether the central bank can halt surging prices without pushing the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; Following the rate hike from the Fed, DoubleLine Capital’s CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime” he believes the central bank is no longer behind the curve on inflation and Powell has regained credibility.
*****
&gt; “This market reaction seems less of a sugar high than the prior two in June and May,” Gundlach said.
*****
&gt; The Dow jumped more than 400 points in the previous session, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.6% and 4.06%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All S&amp;P 500 sectors ended the day higher, with communications services posting its best daily performance since April 2020.
*****
&gt; “For the most part, what’s really driving this move is that the economy is still performing okay and it looks like the Fed is probably going to slow the pace of tightening down by the next policy meeting,” said Ed Moya, Oanda’s senior market analyst.
*****
&gt; Investors have grown increasingly concerned in recent months that the central bank’s attempts to tame surging prices would move the economy closer to a recession, if it hasn’t already entered one.
*****
&gt; Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said during a press conference he does not believe the economy has entered a recession.
*****
&gt; “I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession and the reason is there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,” he said.
*****
&gt; Investors looking for further clues into the state of the economy are awaiting a reading on second-quarter GDP slated for Thursday. While two back-to-back negative quarters of growth is viewed by many as a recession, the official definition is more nuanced, taking into account additional factors, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
*****
&gt; Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the economy to have barely expanded last quarter after contracting 1.6% in the first.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front, investors are looking ahead to results from Apple, Amazon, Intel and Roku slated for after the bell.

*****

#[S&amp;P 500 futures gain after strong Apple, Amazon reports as index heads for best month since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/stock-market-news-updates-open-to-close-future.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Friday as Wall Street looked to finish the week and the month higher.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 66 points, or 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was set to post strong weekly gains. The Dow is now up nearly 2% for the week, while the S&amp;P 500 the Nasdaq Composite are up 2.8%.
*****
&gt; The major averages were also on pace for their best month of 2022. The Dow is on track for a more than 5% gain for July, while the S&amp;P 500 could finish higher by 7.5%. The Nasdaq Composite, while still in bear market territory, is up more than 10% for the month.
*****
&gt; That performance is a stark contrast from the previous six months when stocks tumbled to their June bear market. The market reversed as investors fears about the aggressive pacing of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases started to wane and the idea that inflation has peaked began to settle in.
*****
&gt; Futures Thursday were supported by gains from two of the market’s biggest stocks. Amazon shares popped 12% after the e-commerce giant reported stronger-than-expected sales for the previous quarter, while Apple climbed 2.6% after posting better-than-expected iPhone revenue.
*****
&gt; Chevron and Exxon Mobil also posted better-than-expected results for the previous quarter, sending their shares higher.
*****
&gt; However, the latest batch of corporate results has been mixed.
*****
&gt; Shares of Roku sank more than 20% after the company missed estimates and warned of a slowdown in advertising. Chipmaker Intel dropped 7% after its quarterly results fell short of expectations.
*****
&gt; These moves come after a three-quarters of a percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a negative GDP reading on Thursday.
*****
&gt; “The market is taking on a hope that slowing economic growth is going to result in a more dovish Fed moving forward, even if it’s a little further out. So it would make sense to me that weaker rates expectations moving forward would result in a little buoyancy in the equity markets,” said Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist of New York Life Investments.
*****
&gt; However, Goodwin cautioned that the unusual economic environment and the long period before the next Fed meeting make it difficult to predict the central bank’s path from here.
*****
&gt; Investors will get updated looks at a key inflation reading and second-quarter employment costs on Friday, which could be key data points for the Fed as it considers its next move.

# **Stocks head into August with a tailwind, as investors await jobs data and a slew of earnings - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/stocks-head-into-august-with-a-tailwind-as-investors-await-jobs-data-and-a-slew-of-earnings.html)**
*****
&gt; From Caterpillar to Amgen, dozens of large companies report earnings in the coming week, but it may be big economic data, such as Friday’s jobs report, that takes over as a major market catalyst.
*****
&gt; Monthly employment reports are always important, but the next few may be even more so. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear at his press briefing Wednesday that the Fed’s September rate decision will depend on economic data.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week, helped by better-than-expected earnings reports and a view that the Federal Reserve may not be as aggressive as it forecast when it comes to interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The major stock market indexes ended July with their best monthly performance of the year, and the S&amp;P 500 and Dow scored their best months since November 2020. The Nasdaq’s 12.3% gain was its best monthly performance since April 2020.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P was up 4.3% for the week and 9.1% for the month of July. It is still down 13.3% for the year. The Nasdaq was up 4.7% for the week. The Dow was up nearly 3% for the week and 6.7% for the month.
*****
&gt; “Earnings stink, but they’re not as bad as they could have been,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “The Fed raised rates the most aggressively since 1981, but that’s good because the economy is slowing down, and that’s good because the Fed might start tapering its tone.”
*****
&gt; Some of the biggest names in tech delivered earnings beats in the past week, and their stocks were higher, such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. There have also been some big misses and negative forecasts, like from Meta Platforms and Intel. Intel was down 8.6% Friday after its earnings miss and lowered forecast.
*****
&gt; “Thus far the market has been able to digest it,” said Art Hogan, chief investment strategist at National Securities. “A lot of this is better than feared. If that process continues, it’s likely to help the market grind higher. The market seems to be sitting on this notion that we had priced in Armageddon and thus far, that has not been thrust upon us.”
*****
&gt; Hogan said many investors were caught underinvested or even short stocks during the July rally.
“That helps throw some gasoline on the fire,” he said.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, there are 148 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings. Reports come from a diverse group of companies, such as health-care names Eli Lilly, Gilead Sciences and Amgen. There will also be reports from travel-related companies, such as Uber and Booking Holdings.
*****
&gt; Stocks enter August riding the optimism of July, but since 1995, the S&amp;P 500 has declined by an average 0.5% in the month, according to CFRA. August has also been the third most volatile month, and only three major S&amp;P sectors over that time had averaged gains for the month: real estate, technology and utilities.
*****
&gt; Tech’s outperformance during the month does help the Nasdaq, and the Nasdaq 100 increased an average 0.9% in August, going back to 1995, according to CFRA.
*****
&gt; “It’s a month that could go either way because it has among the highest single monthly advances while at the same time among the deepest single monthly decline,” said Stovall. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 gained 11.6% in August 1992, and fell 14.6% in August 1998.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the S&amp;P 500 could be tested early in the week. The S&amp;P ended the week at 4,130. “Around 4,150 is a very important resistance level,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Recession?
&gt; Investors have been worried about the prospect that the Federal Reserve’s tightening could push the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; However, Thursday’s report that second-quarter gross domestic product declined by 0.9% was taken in stride, in part because the market has been betting the Fed will have to slow down its hiking. The economy has now contracted two quarters in a row, and it is considered to be in what some economists say is a “technical recession.” But most say it is not yet a real recession because of labor market strength and other factors.
*****
&gt; The markets are focused on the potential for a bigger slowdown — particularly the bond market. In the past week, the closely watched 10-year yield fell to 2.64% from 2.75% the week earlier. Yields fall when prices rise, and the 10-year note was lifted by buyers who were concerned about economic weakness.
*****
&gt; The 10-year’s yield is important since mortgage rates and other business and consumer loans are influenced by it.
*****
&gt; “The top tier U.S. data is important for this recession narrative. One thing that kicked off recession talk was the ISM services data, so ISM is going to be important,” said NatWest’s John Briggs. Services ISM slowed less than expected in June, but a measure of employment within the report fell to a two-year low.
*****
&gt; The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing survey is released on Monday, and the ISM services report is due out Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders have been betting in the futures market that the Fed will have to start cutting rates next year, but the Fed’s forecast does not show that. The Fed raised its target fed funds rate by 0.75% of a percentage point Wednesday, the second hike in a row of that size. The next rate hike, expected in September, could be smaller.
*****
&gt; Briggs said the market’s recession worries may be overdone.
*****
&gt; “The jobs report has to be not bad. Powell called the labor market extremely tight, so I just think the market went a little bit overboard here,” said Briggs, “Now it just needs to be not terrible.”
*****
&gt; The July employment report Friday morning is expected to show the economy added 250,000 jobs, according to Dow Jones. That is down from 372,000 jobs added in June.
*****
&gt; “If the jobs report is bad, to me it’s not more good news. ... If the jobs report is bad, it’s more information we’re just begging this recession rather than finishing this recession,” said David Bianco, chief investment officer, Americas at DWS.
*****
&gt; Bianco said he expects the economy is heading for a recession but because of inflation, not the Fed’s rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The big issue for the stock market is tech and how it’s doing since it dominates the market, Bianco said.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks were slammed by rising interest rates, as the 10-year yield climbed earlier in the year. Investors pay up for growth and tech stocks because of the promise of future earnings.
*****
&gt; “People say if the 10-year is done going up, how bad are the technology earnings going to be?” said Bianco. “I caution with the idea that tech will be damaged by recession and a strong dollar and this [would be] from spending on the consumer side and the business side of technology. It’s not that valuations are cheap. ... This may be a shallow recession, but I’m not convinced it’s going to be a short one.”
*****
&gt; Bianco said he likes utilities, health care and aerospace and defense. “For those that want to take a cyclical risk, I like the big banks,” he said. He said the banks do not have the balance sheet issues they had in the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; “The overnight rate is going to be the driver of their net interest margins, especially at the big banks,” he said. “Banks are in a better position than they normally are in a recession.”

&gt; # Fed Chair Powell: The Comeback Kid

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 1% on each of the last four Fed Days going back to March. The March meeting was the first rate hike of the Fed's current tightening cycle, and every meeting since then has seen a hike of at least 50 basis points. Each time, the S&amp;P surged on the day of the hike.

&gt; The recent equity market strength on Fed Days is a new trend. Market performance on Fed Days during Powell's first few years at the helm was notoriously weak. Below we show the S&amp;P 500's average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair since 1994 when policy changes first started being announced on the same day as the meeting. For Chair Powell, we show the S&amp;P's average performance on Fed Days during his tenure only through July 2021. At the time a year ago, Powell Fed Days were by far the worst of any Fed chair, and the market typically plunged into the close after the 2 PM ET announcement.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Powell-1a.png))**

&gt; What a difference a year makes. Below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair updated through the most recent FOMC meeting this week. Whereas Powell Fed Days were by far the worst for the market at this time last year, they're now the second best behind only Bernanke Fed Days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Powell-1b.png))**

&gt; To highlight the improvement in the market response to Fed Chair Powell another way, below we show the full-day percentage change of the S&amp;P 500 on Fed Days during Powell's tenure as well as how the cumulative averages have evolved for both the full-day change and performance from 2:30 PM ET through the close (encapsulating the market response to the presser, or the chair more directly).

&gt; As you can see, the S&amp;P was extremely weak on Powell Fed Days early on during his tenure, but over the last year, the market has reacted extremely positively. Seven of the last eight Powell Fed Days have seen positive moves for the S&amp;P, with the last four all seeing gains of more than 1%.

&gt; # Typical August Trading: Usually a Tepid Month

&gt; Money flows from harvesting once made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. However since then and even more recently, over the last 21-years, August has been a disappointing month. The first eight or nine trading days have historically been weak with the major indexes shedding around 0.4% to 1.2%. This weakness is then followed by a brief mid-month rally that typically lasts until the 13th trading day. From there until late month the indexes have tended to wander sideways to lower before springing back to life ahead of month’s end.

&gt; # August’s First Trading Day Weakest of All

&gt; On page 90 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022, it is shown that the first trading days of each month combined have produced an outsized share of the market’s overall gains. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2022 Almanac. In the upcoming 2023 edition of the Almanac August’s first trading day is still the worst. In the past 24 years DJIA has risen just 36.4% (up 8, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Several sizable gains in those up years, have mitigated the average first day percent change, but the median performance is a more sizable loss. Over the past 11 years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined 8 times.

&gt; # Worst Year for Sentiment On Record

&gt; Bullish sentiment measured by the weekly AAII survey has been a series of back and forth moves over the past several weeks. After reaching the highest level in over a month last week, bullish sentiment fell back down to 27.7%. Even with that decline, bullish sentiment has now managed to hold above 25% for at least three weeks in a row for the first time since the start of the year. We also must note, that the AAII survey collects data from Thursday at 12:01 AM through Wednesday 11:59 PM meaning any boost to sentiment from yesterday's FOMC post-meeting rally will not necessarily be fully captured in this report.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Whereas bullish sentiment has had its fair share of back and forth moves, bearish sentiment has more consistently fallen with this week being the third sequential decline in a row. Now at 40%, bearish sentiment is at the lowest level since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the drop in bulls was slightly smaller than that of bears this week, the bull-bear spread continued to move in a less negative direction. However, in spite of any improvement, this week was the 17th negative reading in a row as that streak remains the third longest on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-3a-1.png))**

&gt; Not only have bears outnumbered bulls for 17 straight weeks, but there has actually only been one week this year (the final week of March) in which that was not the case. As a result, this year is on pace to have averaged the lowest levels of bullish sentiment and the highest levels of bearish sentiment of any year in the survey's history.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-3b.png))**

&gt; With both bulls and bears lower in the most recent survey, neutral sentiment picked up the difference rising to 32.2%. That is the most elevated reading since April and back into the middle of the post-pandemic range.

&gt; # Big Revision in Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims continue to disappoint. Although this week's release technically fell down to 256K, it was from a 10K upwardly revised number of 261K last week. Both this week and last's readings are the highest since the fall and would also mark the highest readings since the fall of 2017 outside of the historically elevated readings of the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; The pandemic was a volatile time period for jobless claims data as readings rose into the millions. As such, revisions over the past couple of years have gotten historically large in turn, albeit less so over the past year. Although it may not sound like much, last week's 10K revision was actually sizable. It was the largest revision since the week of July 4th last year, and prior to the pandemic, the week before Christmas in 2012 was the last time there was a double-digit revision.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-2a.png))**

&gt; In his post meeting presser, Fed Chair Powell mentioned how the rise in initial jobless claims may be seasonal in nature. While we will provide some more in depth analysis to these comments in regards to the data in tonight's Closer, as we have noted in the past, jobless claims have been roughly following standard historical seasonal patterns this year. July typically sees a temporary seasonal spike higher, but as we noted last week, that seasonal peak appears to have been put in place a bit later than usual which is rare but not exactly an unprecedented occurrence. While claims will likely get some seasonal tailwinds in the coming weeks (including this week of the year as claims have fallen around 90% of the time historically), the actual level of claims for the current week of the year is now well above comparable weeks for the few years prior to the pandemic. In other words, before or after seasonal adjustment, claims have come off their strongest levels and revisions have not exactly made things any better.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, the latest week saw a 25K decline to 1.359 million. While that does mark some deterioration from the strongest levels, unlike initial claims, continuing claims are still well below levels from prior to the pandemic indicating a still very healthy labor market the likes of which has not been seen in decades as the insured unemployment rate (continuing claims as a percentage of the number of those covered by state insurance programs) continues to hover near 1%.

&gt; # Most Countries Remain Below Pre-COVID Highs

&gt; As we do the last Wednesday of each month, today we published our latest update of the Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the major economic data and financial markets of 22 major global economies. Taking a look at the US ETFs tracking these same countries shows a broad move higher in equities around the globe during the month of July. The US has led the way higher as the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) has rallied just over 5%. India (INDA), Sweden (EWD), and Singapore (EWS) have seen the next strongest moves with each one rallying 4% or more. That has brought US equities, India, and Singapore back above their 50-DMAs as well.

&gt; Given those moves are in the context of much larger pullbacks year to date, most country ETFs also currently remain below their pre-COVID highs (the 52-week high as of the S&amp;P 500 peak on 2/19/20). In fact, SPY, INDA, Taiwan (EWT), and Canada (EWC) are the only countries meaningfully above prior highs. Switzerland (EWL) is also technically a part of that list, but the one basis point difference is not much of a margin. At the moment, Brazil is down the most significantly from its pre-COVID high as it is still down 43%. However, unlike many other countries, the year-to-date decline has been very modest at only 1.76%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072722-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at the charts of the four countries that are handily above their pre-COVID highs, the trends of the past year are not exactly positive. Each one currently sits in a multi-month downtrend, and only India and the US have managed to break above their 50-DMAs. Even if those moving averages have been taken out, further progress by bulls would be required to eliminate those downtrends.

1659140886,0,"I have a question for y’all, about DCAing when a stock is up. So I bought into a lot of stocks at a really high price, between September and December of last year. This put my average costs CRAZY high. If I didn’t DCA for example, on TSLA, I’d have Tesla stock at around $1,150 a stock. I’ve since DCA’d down to like $820 or something, so I’m actually up now. 


This is the same with many other stocks I own and crypto. I buy every day. So my question is now, as the market has kinda baby bounced back a bit. Do you guys still just keep buying when stocks are up, and you’re in the green on them? It feels counter productive but I also know timing the market is impossible.



Btw, TSLA was just an example most of my money is in broad market ETFs.","question y’all, dcaing stock up. bought lot stocks really high price, september december last year. put average costs crazy high. didn’t dca example, tsla, i’d tesla stock around $1,150 stock. i’ve since dca’d like $820 something, i’m actually now. many stocks crypto. buy every day. question now, market kinda baby bounced back bit. guys still keep buying stocks up, you’re green them? feels counter productive also know timing market impossible. btw, tsla example money broad market etfs.","['DCA', 'Tesla']"

I'm a Bogglehead, for the most part, that got a bit too invested in the rise in Tech in 2020 and 2021. I bought quite a bit of SE and SQ and am now down roughly 65% in each position. 

Rather than wait for these stocks to get back to my cost basis price, I had a thought to sell and invest the remainder into more concrete companies (what some are calling ""value Tech"") like AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG. I have exposure in each of these already via my ETFs, but thought that a direct position might help accelerate returns on what's been lost with SE and SQ.

Only thing is, to regain losses, AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG have to rise to substantial levels, basically becoming $4T companies. 

What are your thoughts? Should I stick with SE and SQ and hope for the best? Or, should I sell and invest into better Tech companies?

Thanks in advance.","hi r/stocks, bogglehead, part, got bit invested rise tech 2020 2021. bought quite bit se sq roughly 65% position. rather wait stocks get back cost basis price, thought sell invest remainder concrete companies (what calling ""value tech"") like aapl, msft, goog. exposure already via etfs, thought direct position might help accelerate returns what's lost se sq. thing is, regain losses, aapl, msft, goog rise substantial levels, basically becoming $4t companies. thoughts? stick se sq hope best? or, sell invest better tech companies? thanks advance.","['Tech', 'AT&T', 'GOOG', 'Apple', 'Microsoft']"
1659213229,21,"**Original thesis:**

* **Quick introduction**: I've been an investor in ROKU since **2020** right before HBO Max made a deal to be available on ROKU. I've invested **over $100K** into the company via dollar cost average and have lost **+60%** of my investment due to poor stock performance.
* **Active accounts**: More people are going to cut the cord because cable is more expensive &amp; less flexible than streaming. Along with international expansion, this would have helped ROKU add **+10m** active accounts per a year.
* **Average revenue per user**: Shift of advertising dollars from Linear TV to Streaming TV. In 2020, **40%** of U.S. TV time was streamed but only **13%** of TV ad budgets were spent on streaming. This would have helped average revenue per user (*ARPU*) as advertisers &amp; their dollars followed potential customers to close the gap and help ROKU grow revenue by **30% - 40%** on an annual basis.
* **Competitive positioning**: Market leader with **+38%** of U.S. streaming players &amp; **+33%** of U.S. smart TVs has their operating system. Impressive that they have maintained a competitive lead for over a decade against the largest tech companies in the world including Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, and LG.

&amp;#x200B;

**What has changed from my past thesis that's negative:**

* **Active Accounts will be lower-than-expected**: ROKU pulled forward multiple years of customer growth during the COVID pandemic as people were stuck at home &amp; needed a smart TV. So the company is closer to maturity as it penetrated most of its TAM especially in the U.S. My expectation for active account growth is to be **5m - 8m** per year, which will primarily be low-value accounts from their international expansion that have a lower monetization value along with a few high-value U.S. accounts that will be acquired as households continue to leave cable &amp; defections from competition.
* **More cyclical than I thought**: I thought that ROKU would enjoy a **30% - 40%** revenue CAGR as advertising dollars shift from linear TV to streaming TV. But, ROKU just withdrew it's guidance for **35% y/y** revenue growth in FY '22 and will most likely only grow in the **high-teens** as advertisers pull back on marketing spend in response to the economy.
* **OneView &amp; the dynamic programmatic ads is overrated**: They are immaterial to the business and it's best to focus on the fundamental blocks for the company today. ROKU primarily gets most of their advertising dollars from the scatter market and a little from upfronts. The ads will work similarly as linear TV.  I'm not going to get distracted by the other parts of the business.

&amp;#x200B;

**What has changed from my past thesis that's positive:**

* **Netflix &amp; other streaming players offering an AVOD option**: My base case was that Netflix &amp; most of the larger streaming apps would offer an ad-free subscription. But, Netflix &amp; Disney + are now more open-minded to an AVOD (*advertising video on demand option*), which may attract more households to leave cable because they can now better afford subscriptions since the AVOD options generally are priced at a 25% - 50% discount. This provides a little relief to my outlook for ROKU's active account growth, but I'm more excited this will help boost my outlook for ROKU's ARPU since ROKU gets a **20% - 30%** share of advertising.
* **Sports being offered on streaming**: Three items I see holding back households from leaving cable: it would be too expensive to bundle multiple streaming apps to watch all of the content a household wants, no sports, and no news. The AVOD options from streaming apps addresses point 1 while streaming apps are also addressing point 2.  NFL, NBA, MLB, and MLS are now available to be streamed that I didn't expect before especially given the lucrative deals all of these leagues  originally signed to be on linear TV.
* **IDFA, digital privacy changes from Apple, and upcoming for Google**: I didn't expect this to happen. This is making it really difficult for advertisers to efficiently target customers that rely on tracking customers based on their iPhone activity. I expect Google to do something similar for Android &amp; Chrome. ROKU stands to benefit not only from linear TV ad dollars shifting to streaming, but also ad dollars from mobile as advertisers look for an effective option to target customers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What hasn't changed from my past thesis:**

* **Shift from cable to streaming**: **47.6%** of U.S. households stream and is expected to be **57.6%** by 2026
* **Shift of advertising dollars from Linear TV to Streaming TV: 50%** of U.S. TV time is streamed, but only **22%** of TV ad budgets is spent on streaming. That gap will need to close as advertisers need to follow where the customers are at.
* **Competitive positioning**: ROKU has maintained a competitive lead for over a decade against the largest tech companies in the world including Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, and LG. If these companies couldn't topple ROKU for over a decade and ROKU hasn't slipped in their product roadmap, how can one seriously expect them to change that dynamic?

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I'm still holding and I may buy more:**

* **Balancing my original thesis against things that have changed**: Most of my original thesis **remains**, but has been **weakened** due to me overestimating customer growth after the pandemic, the secular resilience of the company, and the impact of initiatives that are a small part of their business. There are a few new items like tailwinds from AVOD streaming options, sports, and IDFA tailwinds. But on a net-net, my thesis has been the weakened and ROKU's stock already reflects that by going from the **high $400s to the $60s**.
* **TINA**: I can't think of many stocks that will generate strong shareholder value in a challenging stock market &amp; macro environment. **There is no alternative** so I figured how about I stay &amp; invest in a beaten down company and ROKU's stock will probably rise a lot faster than other stocks when the environment improves since it's a smaller company, more sensitive to an improving economy given the reliance on advertising spend, ROKU is not losing to competitors, and streaming TV is not losing to other industries.
* **Negative stock perception**: The recent earnings call was horrible for ROKU and analysts across Wall Street has responded with downgrades including Bank of America with a **$55** price target. I find it difficult to find good opportunities in stocks that everyone crowds around and I'm hoping to take advantage of the poor sentiment today, ROKU continuing to execute with all of the tailwinds in streaming TV industry, and eventually ROKU's stock will go up when the economy &amp; advertising spend improves
* **Potential acquisition target if things get really bad**: ROKU is the #1 TV operating system and has over 60m accounts. The company's market cap is over **$8 billion**, so it's a feasible &amp; attractive acquisition target for a big tech company that wants to be the gatekeeper in the streaming TV ecosystem. I expect ROKU to weather the tough economy, keep executing, and continue operating as an independent company. But, it makes me comfortable that ROKU does a really good job at its niche and many companies will find what ROKU does is attractive if an acquisition is potentially the best exit option for investors.","**original thesis:** * **quick introduction**: investor roku since **2020** right hbo max made deal available roku. invested **over $100k** company via dollar cost average lost **+60%** investment due poor stock performance. * **active accounts**: people going cut cord cable expensive less flexible streaming. along international expansion, would helped roku add **+10m** active accounts per year. * **average revenue per user**: shift advertising dollars linear tv streaming tv. 2020, **40%** u.s. tv time streamed **13%** tv ad budgets spent streaming. would helped average revenue per user (*arpu*) advertisers dollars followed potential customers close gap help roku grow revenue **30% - 40%** annual basis. * **competitive positioning**: market leader **+38%** u.s. streaming players **+33%** u.s. smart tvs operating system. impressive maintained competitive lead decade largest tech companies world including amazon, google, apple, samsung, lg. #x200b; **what changed past thesis that's negative:** * **active accounts lower-than-expected**: roku pulled forward multiple years customer growth covid pandemic people stuck home needed smart tv. company closer maturity penetrated tam especially u.s. expectation active account growth **5m - 8m** per year, primarily low-value accounts international expansion lower monetization value along high-value u.s. accounts acquired households continue leave cable defections competition. * **more cyclical thought**: thought roku would enjoy **30% - 40%** revenue cagr advertising dollars shift linear tv streaming tv. but, roku withdrew guidance **35% y/y** revenue growth fy '22 likely grow **high-teens** advertisers pull back marketing spend response economy. * **oneview dynamic programmatic ads overrated**: immaterial business best focus fundamental blocks company today. roku primarily gets advertising dollars scatter market little upfronts. ads work similarly linear tv. going get distracted parts business. #x200b; **what changed past thesis that's positive:** * **netflix streaming players offering avod option**: base case netflix larger streaming apps would offer ad-free subscription. but, netflix disney + open-minded avod (*advertising video demand option*), may attract households leave cable better afford subscriptions since avod options generally priced 25% - 50% discount. provides little relief outlook roku's active account growth, excited help boost outlook roku's arpu since roku gets **20% - 30%** share advertising. * **sports offered streaming**: three items see holding back households leaving cable: would expensive bundle multiple streaming apps watch content household wants, sports, news. avod options streaming apps addresses point 1 streaming apps also addressing point 2. nfl, nba, mlb, mls available streamed expect especially given lucrative deals leagues originally signed linear tv. * **idfa, digital privacy changes apple, upcoming google**: expect happen. making really difficult advertisers efficiently target customers rely tracking customers based iphone activity. expect google something similar android chrome. roku stands benefit linear tv ad dollars shifting streaming, also ad dollars mobile advertisers look effective option target customers. #x200b; **what changed past thesis:** * **shift cable streaming**: **47.6%** u.s. households stream expected **57.6%** 2026 * **shift advertising dollars linear tv streaming tv: 50%** u.s. tv time streamed, **22%** tv ad budgets spent streaming. gap need close advertisers need follow customers at. * **competitive positioning**: roku maintained competitive lead decade largest tech companies world including amazon, google, apple, samsung, lg. companies topple roku decade roku slipped product roadmap, one seriously expect change dynamic?

4.Low market cap - ETSY market cap at the moment is 13 Billion.some people might say it's not low but considering how much this company can grow ETSY can reach huge growth numbers,if it reaches Amazon valuation this is x100 growth and even if it doesn't the company can still have a very impressive growth.

5.Impressive Returns - ETSY ipo was 7 years ago at 16$ a share.the current price is 103$ and that's after the stock crashed more than 60%.i think having more than 500% reutrn after holding the stock for 7 years is a very impressive return.and the company have a lot more room to grow.

1659457020,48,"Per the title. I'm curious about how you originally identified what are now your longest/best holdings. What made you take notice of those companies in the first place? What have you learned from whatever methodology you used to locate those top picks?

I think it's useful to honestly look back at the original thesis/logic if we want to replicate success. It's easy to get sidetracked with strategy, but in the end, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak...so what went into your pudding?

&amp;#x200B;

**For me:**

The longer I continue my journey with stocks (\~15 years now), the more I favor getting back to the basic axiom of investing in what you know. Of course this is a well known strategy (Peter Lynch, etc.), but I've been thinking more about it lately in the context of my own portfolio and how it has evolved over time. Most of the stocks that turned out best for me follow this rule, though I wasn't explicitly following the Lynch playbook at purchase (because I didn't know who he was at the time).

My top 5 most successful (and also longest...not a coincidence) holdings are:

* AAPL - 10 years - bought my first iPhone and was absolutely blown away by it, coming from an Android device. iPhone seemed almost absurdly better than its nearest competition at that time, which seemed like a pretty good baseline investment thesis. 
* COST - 8 years - bought after visiting a Costco with my parents in law and then immediately joining myself.  Came to the stock as a result. I still love Costco, the company and the stock.
* CRM - 5 years - bought after selecting Salesforce as our main operations hub at my former employer. Became familiar with Salesforce admin, saw the platform's power and flexibility, saw it in action, saw how it moved the dial, saw how it quickly becomes a must-have tool. 
* UPS - 5 years - Was working a lot with FedEx. Their service was slipping and prices were going up. Missed deliveries. Not easy to deal with. Started using UPS...better service, better store experience, better prices, more reliable deliveries. Bought the stock. And of course they started eating FedEx's lunch.
* AVGO - 4 years - This is the outlier. I bought based on a generally favorable outlook for semis, and they seemed highly financially secure, are broadly exposed to the semiconductor industry (sort of a picks and shovels play; AMAT is my other), and pay a large and growing dividend. Worked out well despite my lack of direct personal knowledge.

Conclusion: I didn't read Lynch until relatively recently, and I wish I'd discovered him earlier, because the foundation of my portfolio is composed of my ""Lynch stocks"", and in hindsight, I could have avoided a lot of painful lessons and headhaches if I'd just started out picking from a basket of companies I know, like, admire and trust.

I'm increasingly thinking that ""invest in what you know"" is less about finding the best companies - though that's part of it - and more about finding the deep conviction to hang tight over many years, which is where a lot of the outperformance is generated.

I also note that none of these picks were particularly cheap when I bought them. The best companies are rarely cheap.

Thoughts? Experiences?

1659510495,12,"Lately the idea has stuck with me that you should think of stocks as the means to becoming a part owner of a company in order to support them. As Warren Buffet has said, you should try to find great companies with stocks at great prices.

So the IDEA is now in my head that I can start researching and hunting for companies that match my interests and entice me to give them some of my money for support. 

But this gets a little difficult because it becomes a matter of searching for information that might not be easily accessible, and leaves me with many questions. 

For example, should 90% of my research consist of sifting through their spendings/annual report to work out if they're making decent profit, giving back to the shareholders, and spending their money wisely? Is there really any way to work out if the CEO or another high-up is corrupt and will fuck over the company in the long-run? Can you learn about how a company functions other than what THEY provide on their website (which will obviously always be postively-biased) or new articles?

For companies like Amazon and Apple there would be an abundance of information available. They're billion dollar companies and they must be mostly transparent. But for smaller startup companies I feel as though information can be very sparse. 

Is this where I must enter super-businessman mode and rock up in person to get a feel for how the company operates, and whether the staff are motivated to work, or if it's actually a shit company that no one wants to work at?

1659513699,0,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan could threaten the buildup of the electric-vehicle supply chain in North America. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that a decision about the location of a new battery plant in Nort America from Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (ticker: 300750.China), which is better known as CATL, would be delayed because of the trip. CATL didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The company is the world’s largest maker of EV batteries and the plant in North America would have been its first. Output for the plant has been tied to Ford Motor (F) and Tesla (TSLA). Ford, for instance, disclosed in late July that CATL would supply the auto maker with lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries. LFP batteries are cheaper than batteries with more expensive metals such as cobalt. LFP batteries don’t pack as much energy, but still are a good option for auto makers looking to manage costs on EVs with lower per charge range. Ford Motor and Tesla didn’t respond request for comment from Barron’s.

Most batteries for EVs today are made in Asia, and most EV battery materials are processed in China. That makes some sense since China sells the most EVs. China has also made it easy to build manufacturing capacity in the country. (China accounted for roughly 30% of the world’s manufacturing output in 2021, according to the World Bank, up from about 20% in 2011 and about 10% in 2006.)

U.S. auto makers are trying to shift battery market share to the West. Ford and Tesla along, with other global auto makers including General Motors (GM), have announced billions in battery capacity and deals that help localize the supply chain. Most of the capacity is being built in partnership with existing battery makers including LG Chem (051910.Korea) and SK Innovation (096770.Korea). Existing battery makers including Panasonic (6752.Japan) are also building North American-based capacity on their own.

A lot of spending is scheduled from many parties besides CATL. And the reported delay in site selection could be just that — a delay. Still, a potential delay is a reminder that geopolitics are complicated.

CATL fell 3.8% on Wednesday in Shanghai. Ford shares dropped 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla gained 1.1%. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, on Tuesday.

Ticker: NASDAQ:CYBE 

Market Cap: $296M

Price per share (8/4/22): $40.50

CyberOptics (NASDAQ:CYBE) is an excellent picks and shovels play on the continued growth of the semiconductor industry. The chip shortage that is still ongoing shed a light on major supply chain issues and accelerated developments like the passing of the US CHIPS Act, which includes $52 billion in subsidies to encourage chip manufacturers to build out semiconductor fabrication plants in the US. A major catalyst for the stock price could be Mr Market waking up to the Apple mini-LED connection. The important point to keep in mind is that there is additional growth coming later 2022/early 2023 that Mr market is not expecting.

Other catalysts are earnings growth, multiple expansion and big order announcements for WaferSense.

To sum up,

* **Hidden champion in sensor &amp; inspection technology**
* **Picks and shovels play on the semiconductor industry**
* **Own near 100% market share of wireless real time wafer sensors**

# **S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq fall Friday, but notch weekly gains after blowout July jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/04/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks wavered Friday in a volatile trading session after the July jobs report was much better than expected, as investors assessed what a strong labor market would mean for the Federal Reserve’s rate tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 76.65 points, or 0.23%, to end at 32,803.47. Even with Friday’s gains, however, it fell on the week. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.16% to end at 4,145.19, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.50% Friday, falling to 12,657.56. Still, both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the first week of August higher.
*****
&gt; Losses were offset by bank stocks, which rose on hopes that interest rate hikes will continue at a solid clip. Energy stocks also gained, but technology companies slumped.
*****
&gt; The labor market added 528,000 jobs in July, easily beating a Dow Jones estimate of a 258,000 increase. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%, below the 3.6% estimate. Wage growth also rose more than estimated, up 0.5% for the month and 5.2% higher than a year ago, signaling that high inflation is likely still a problem.
*****
&gt; Stocks opened lower following the report, even as it seemed to indicate the economy was not currently in a recession. Job growth was expected to slow as the Fed continues to hike interest rates to tame inflation, but this report shows a labor market still running hot. That means the central bank may act more aggressively at its next meeting.
*****
&gt; “Anybody that jumped on the ‘Fed is going to pivot next year and start cutting rates’ is going to have to get off at the next station, because that’s not in the cards,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. “It is clearly a situation where the economy is not screeching or heading into a recession here and now.”
*****
&gt; Friday’s jobs report is a crucial one as it’s one of two the central bank will see before it decides how much to raise rates at its September meeting. Indeed, traders are already betting on a tougher stance from the Fed. Policy makers will have another jobs report and two more consumer price index numbers to weigh before the central bank makes its next rate decision.
*****
&gt; Major averages posted their best month since 2020 in July on the hope the Fed would slow the pace of its hikes. The S&amp;P 500 added 9.1% last month.

&gt; # Crazy Moves in the Bond Market

&gt; The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) declined over 2% on Friday, which for a sector of the financial universe that is known for its safety, is a relatively rare occurrence. Since the ETF's launch in 2002, only 3.1% of all trading days have been gains or losses of at least 2%. Not only was Friday a big move for TLT, but it was also the third day this week that the ETF was up or down 2% on the trading day. Talk about an uncertain environment! With investors looking to forecast the path and intensity of rate hikes against a backdrop of high inflation, stronger than expected economic data (like Friday's Payroll report) puts upward pressure on yields, while weaker than expected data suggests the economy is cooling off causing bonds to rally and yields to fall.

&gt; As mentioned above, three of the last five trading days have seen daily moves of plus or minus 2%. Only two other periods throughout the history of TLT have seen a higher rate of 2%+ moves in TLT, those being August of 2011 and March of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-rolling-5-day-moves-2-pct-plus-080522.png))**

&gt; Since TLT was launched in 2002, there have only been 22 trading days in which the ETF had moved 2%+ three times over a trailing five-day period. Those occurrences are shown on the chart below and they are clustered around three different periods - the Financial Crisis, the US debt downgrade in 2011, and the COVID crash. Needless to say, these were all very tumultuous periods in the markets and economy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-2-pct-plus-moves-080522.png))**

&gt; Interestingly, there have been seven years since 2002 in which TLT has had less 2%+ percent daily moves than we have had in the last five days! For the entire year, this week's three occurrences take the total number of 2% daily moves for TLT to 17. There are still five months left in 2022, but if there wasn't another day with a gain or loss of 2%, this year would still rank fourth in terms of total 2%+ moves. Not only that, but if this year's pace were to continue, it would put 2022 on track for a record twenty-nine 2% moves, surpassing the prior record of 22 from 2011.

&gt; # Bulls Battle Bears at June Highs Resistance

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/168e9202a6ea40b786baf20d81511e1d/2279401a758717ed-7e/s500x750/c250da0155017e894ca36962e510af72bcb7c653.jpg))**

&gt; The game is on as the market awaits tomorrow’s employment report and to see if the other shoe is going to drop on layoffs. Not to mention any deeper impact on the economy from inflation and the prospect of more aggressive rate increases from the Fed.

&gt; We are taking the excitement over the renewed bullish sentiment with a grain of salt. There was a similar rise in bullish sentiment at the end March as that rally stalled just before the bottom fell out.

&gt; Investors Intelligence Bulls/Bears Difference also rallied back above zero in late-March as it has the last few weeks. Red circles in the chart show comparable moves above zero during the 2008-2009 and 2015-2016 bears well before those bottoms.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e80a553812873e305997cb9d7ef5e8bc/2279401a758717ed-ab/s500x750/fb01490b7c7de49faa315e345180059cc38c6474.jpg))**

&gt; We may yet push a bit higher, but our cycles and indicators are still pointing to a retest of the June lows with the potential for a lower low before the bottom over the next three months.

***** 

&gt; # Bulls Back Above 30%

&gt; While the rally has paused today, the S&amp;P 500 has continued to press higher in the past week and is currently hovering near resistance at the late May/early June highs. In response to those moves, investor sentiment has improved with the weekly survey from the AAII showing over 30% of respondents reporting as bullish. That is the highest reading since the first week of June when the S&amp;P 500 was at similar levels to now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment is a similar story in hitting the lowest level since the first week of June as it has fallen back below 40%. The further 1.2 percentage point drop marks the fourth week in a row that bearish sentiment has fallen, and the full decline since the recent high of 59.3% on June 23rd now sits at over 20 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; In spite of those further improvements, there continues to be more bears than bulls as the spread remains in negative territory. As shown in the second chart below, the bull bear spread has now been negative for 18 weeks in a row.

&gt; In addition to the drop in bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment was also lower falling 1.6 percentage points down to 30.6%. That is the first time neutral sentiment matched bullish sentiment since May of last year.

&gt; # Strongest July in Post-WWII Era

&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed over 140 basis points higher on the back of favorable earnings from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon (XOM). This was the third straight day in which the S&amp;P 500 gained at least one percent, allowing bulls to breathe a sigh of relief after a tough start to the year. These moves came even as a second consecutive quarter of negative real GDP growth was reported and the Fed hikes rates by 75 basis points.

&gt; Friday's move helped the S&amp;P 500 post its best July in the post-WWII era, finishing with a gain of 9.2%. Although the index is still close to 14% off of its early January highs, the market looks more inviting than it did at the beginning of the month, when the YTD declines were above 20%. As investors, we could just give ourselves high fives for the month, but it's vital to remain forward-looking. Following July gains of 5%+, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.6% in August (median: +1.4%), performing positively 60 percent of the time. Between the start of August and the end of the calendar year, the index has averaged a gain of 8.0% (median: +10.0%), gaining 80% of the time. Over the following twelve months (starting in August), the index has averaged an impressive gain of 15.6% (median: +15.4%), rallying 87% of the time. Based on past history, bull runs in July tend to bode well for the market for both the rest of the year and over the following twelve months.

&gt; # Rotating in August

&gt; Following the best July of the post-WWII era, equities have been getting off to a slower start in August with the Russell 3,000 experiencing a modest decline yesterday and the index fighting to move into the green as of midday today. Most of the move to start August appears to a degree to be rotational in nature. In the chart below, we show the average performance of deciles of Russell 3,000 stocks grouped by their performance in the month of July. As shown, both the best and worst performers last month have rallied in early August with the deciles of the worst performers seeing slightly larger gains. The losers this month have been in the middle of the performance spectrum as deciles 4 through 7 are each flat to lower over the past couple of sessions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080222-Deciles-2.png))**

&gt; Equities bottomed in mid-June and have been in rally mode ever since. As for how performance the past couple of days relates to the first half of the year's declines, again the worst performers have generally been outperforming. However, by this measure, the top performers from the 52-week high just after the New Year through the low in June have continued to fall this week.

&gt; # Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ecae7fb5af7b0fc9e5eb39e8799d234f/bd4d1a07ef884772-d5/s500x750/5b86f230776c4ad0a11ef3b49b6f23b328aeeb36.jpg))**

&gt; Inflation, war, recession fears, aggressive Fed rate hikes, lingering supply chain issues, layoffs, earnings misses, and lingering pandemic issues drove the market into official bear market territory last month.

&gt; Driven by hopes of a soft landing, a resilient labor market, pockets of positive economic and corporate results, and some rather seriously oversold conditions in big name tech and growth stocks the market has rallied smartly off the June lows.

&gt; At the end of July DJIA was up 9.9% from the June lows, S&amp;P up 12.6% and NASDAQ up 16.4. Summer rally 2022 has worked the bulls into a frenzy like a matador with his red muleta. DJIA logged its 7th best July since 1950, up 6.7%, qualifying as a “Hot July Market.”

&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of 7.2% on average in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year.

&gt; # Initial Claims Back to the Highs

&gt; Initial jobless claims came in matching expectations at 260K this week, up from last week's downward revision of 254K. That reading leaves claims 1K below the pandemic high set two weeks ago. Those levels are above the pre-pandemic range and consistent with where claims stood in the fall of 2017.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims have the benefit of seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year as the mid-summer peak works itself out. Given this, unadjusted claims have dropped to 205.6K from the high of 258.9K two weeks ago. Although that is a strong level of claims, it is above the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number meaning the most recent reading is as of the week of July 22nd. Although initial claims had fallen that week, continuing claims moved back above 1.4 million for the first time since mid-April. Unlike initial claims, and as we will discuss further in tonight's Closer, the deterioration in continuing claims has been relatively modest as current levels are not only well below levels from the two years pre-pandemic, but this week's reading would still make for some of the best readings since 1970.

1659881057,507,"So the most common thing I hear is just to DCA. Basically hold onto your stocks (which you believe in the company) and buy dips in intervals when it goes down.

But let's say you buy a stock like TSLA. If it goes over $900, you sell 20% for profit and then wait until it goes back down to buy another 20%. Wouldn't that strategy makes more sense in terms of actually getting at least some profits on paper? I feel like holding and not taking any profit is a bit of a waste? What's everyone's opinion on when to sell a small percentage of your portfolio vs just holding?

I mean you can sell 10% or 20% when a particular stock goes up, then buy the dip again when it goes back down.....vs just holding (not taking profits) and buying dips. You would probably make more gains in the long run by selling a small percentage every time the stock runs up?

1660054167,173,"**TL;DR**: Value stocks are calling out for your attention. The value spread is at historically favorable levels (for value stocks), and this predicts strong future earnings relative to growth.

Not since the Dot Com era have we seen value stocks spreading themselves so enticingly.

What is the value spread? Definitions abound, but in general, it measures the relative cheapness of value stocks to growth stocks. For example, one might compare the E/P of value stocks to E/P of growth stocks (the inverse of the P/E ratio). More complex frameworks include metrics such as book/price, forecasted earnings to price, etc. 

But value stocks are cheap for a reason, you say. The literature comes to the rescue: there have been numerous empirical studies verifying that periods of outperformance follow relatively cheap periods. Much as heightened values of the Shiller P/E ratio tends to forecast poor returns, historically cheap value stocks forecast great returns. This phenomenon is pronounced for small cap value.

In fact, simple mean reversion implies large premiums:

&gt; Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.

[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/e3fb3c34-b982-4827-9762-f5b9a8d33dc5)

Let's now present some graphs. From AQR capital, a normalized value spread measure the last few decades: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/PzKHi5Q.png). Here higher is cheaper value. They use a complex mixture to compute valuation, described in their [blog posts](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead).

From the FT, a simpler graph of price/earnings: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/nz83cmC.png). Note that here 'lower' is cheaper since they use P/E instead of E/P.

This phenomenon is robust across the world: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/ytkZewM.png). In fact, the cheapness is even more extreme than Europe: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/P3nudFF.png). An [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/a841583e-4ea7-4ff6-b673-ece22b72f100) explains just how remarkable this is:

&gt; Arnold also writes “value stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they’ve actually de-rated over the last five years.”

&gt; On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: “The Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!”

&gt; Finally, Arnold writes that “over the last five years Europe’s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts . . . so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!” 


Growth has been impressive the past decade, as [Larry Swedroe writes](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/is-small-cap-value-dead/), both in returns and fundamentals. But value stocks has done well for itself, fundamentally.

&gt; While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks — Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks — the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.

Swedroe gives a short literature review on the evidence that this spread predicts returns.  For example,

&gt; Adam Zaremba and Mehmet Umutlu, authors of the March 2019 study Strategies Can Be Expensive Too! The Value Spread and Asset Allocation in Global Equity Markets, examined whether the value spread (the difference in valuation ratios between the long and the short sides of the trade) was useful for forecasting returns on quantitative equity strategies for country selection. To test this, they examined a sample of 120 country-level equity strategies replicated within 72 stock markets for the years 1996 through 2017.

&gt; They found: “The breadth of the value spread can predict the future returns in the cross-section. We show that equity strategies with a wide value spread markedly outperform strategies with a narrow value spread. In other words, if you wonder which strategy might produce decent payoffs in the future, pay attention to the value spread.”

Mean reversion alone predicts strong outperformance, but it is comforting to have empirical evidence across the world verifying that this mean reversion will probably happen.

This cheapness won't last forever, if history is to repeat itself. Eventually, money will flows into such unappreciated value, with strong fundamentals. The time to sin a little and market time is now. Thus, I conclude with a recommendation to buy small cap value ETFs, where the premiums are even higher.","**tl;dr**: value stocks calling attention. value spread historically favorable levels (for value stocks), predicts strong future earnings relative growth. since dot com era seen value stocks spreading enticingly. value spread? definitions abound, general, measures relative cheapness value stocks growth stocks. example, one might compare e/p value stocks e/p growth stocks (the inverse p/e ratio). complex frameworks include metrics book/price, forecasted earnings price, etc. value stocks cheap reason, say. literature comes rescue: numerous empirical studies verifying periods outperformance follow relatively cheap periods. much heightened values shiller p/e ratio tends forecast poor returns, historically cheap value stocks forecast great returns. phenomenon pronounced small cap value. fact, simple mean reversion implies large premiums: &gt; value stocks look like heck value right now! look way. yesterday, value stocks forward p/e 13.4, growth stocks 22.4. ratio 0.57. get back historical average ratio 0.75, assuming stable earnings, value stocks would rise 30 per cent, growth stocks would fall 20 per cent, combination both. little mean reversion would mean lot outperformance value.

# [Stock futures nudge higher as investors brace for July inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/09/stock-futures-tick-up-as-investors-brace-for-july-inflation-report-.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were slightly higher early on Wednesday as investors looked ahead to a key inflation report.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 73 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.3%.
*****
&gt; The moves come after the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq fell for a third straight day on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite led the declines, falling 1.2% after Micron, Novavax and Upstart warned that future earnings and revenue may come in lower than previously thought. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.42%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.18%.
*****
&gt; # Inflation report looms
&gt; Investors are awaiting the latest consumer price index report, which could confirm or dash hopes that rising prices have started to slow. Economists expect the report to show that inflation has cooled slightly, led by slipping oil prices.
*****
&gt; “In terms of reactions, the market will initially get more excited by a downside core CPI surprise than an upside surprise, especially as it relates to risk appetite,” Alan Ruskin of Deutsche Bank wrote in a Tuesday note. “A downside surprise plays to ‘hopes’ that an oil/food commodities peak, plus slower demand, will filter quickly into US inflation data.”
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve will weigh the report, along with other key economic data, ahead of its September meeting where it is slated to hike interest rates again.
*****
&gt; Earnings season also continues, with Disney’s quarterly results due after the bell Wednesday.

Companies using this method can say anything they want during the pre-merger period, and as a consequence they frequently miss their projections by a large margin as Lucid has done in recent weeks

\- During its most recent earnings call, Rivian kept its future vehicle production guidance the same for the remainder of this year. During its most recent earnings call, Lucid reduced its vehicle production guidance for the remainder of this year by 50%!

\- Rivian has Amazon as its customer;

\- Rivian has a 2.5x greater vehicle backlog in units versus Lucid, with an initial deposit requirement 6x as as high relative the vehicle invoice price.  Lucid's deposit for a $160,000 reservation is only $300!   Not much commitment required on the customer's part to reserve a car.  Almost throw away money.

\- I have seen 30+ Rivian trucks on the road here in Sonoma County. I have never seen a Lucid Air on the road.  Ever.

The Lucid Group has roughly the same valuation in terms enterprise value as Rivian.

The recent bear market illustrated to me the danger of holding  heavily in one stock. And although my AMZN stock has now recovered (just about in the green) i feel things could have gone the way of META or NFLX (not to say they wont recover too).

So not sure if i should sell my AMZN and replace it with VOO.

Is anyone else facing this dilema?

ESG RATINGS:

&gt;Sustainalytics gives Tesla an ESG score of 28.6. It’s ranked 42 out of 83 in the automobiles sector, being beaten by the likes of Mercedes-Benz at 22.1 (lower being better).  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is this?  
&gt;  
&gt;[This article](https://www.grcworldforums.com/news-and-insight/teslas-low-esg-score-can-partly-be-explained-by-figure-skating/4101.article) published in February 2022 by the GRC World Forum suggests that the reason for the low ESG score is due to Elon Musk, or more accurately — the analysts opinions of Elon.  
&gt;  
&gt;The author notes:  
&gt;  
&gt;*For transparency, labor relations, adherence to governance, for example, having a CEO who doesn’t send out random tweets, Tesla scores poorly*  
*\[Tesla’s 2019 impact statement\] “was not exactly a statement that endeared Tesla to those who create ESG scores”*  
&gt;  
&gt;Musk is correct about the oil companies here, two oil companies ([OMV AG: 27.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/omv-ag/1008289354) and [Repsol: 26.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/repsol-s-a/1008201748)) both have better scores than Tesla.  
&gt;  
&gt;The key problem here is that E,S and G are all weighted equally, while not close to being equal in practice. E can be quantified, while S and G are entirely subjective. The equal weighting of each metric means that companies outstanding in one area are beaten out by seemingly much worse companies overall because of the other two dimensions.  
&gt;  
&gt;The scores also don’t account for the wider impact that a company might have had, for example Tesla isn’t given get credit for helping to push other automakers towards EV’s. Regardless of how you feel about Tesla or Musk, it’s undeniable that had tesla not proved profitably and consumer demand, the EV market would not be as developed as it is today.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is most egregiously demonstrated by the fact that T[esla has been dropped from the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/18/why-tesla-was-kicked-out-of-the-sp-500s-esg-index.html) for concerns about their working environment after being sued in a racial discrimination lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;You might agree that this is the correct course of action, if so, you will also likely agree that Amazon should be dropped after being sued for telling it’s employees to work through a severe weather warning, [resulting in six of them being killed after the building was hit by a tornado](https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/amazon-sued-by-family-of-employee-killed-in-warehouse-tornado-collapse-085656743.html), yet amazon remains the funds third largest holding.  
&gt;  
&gt;You might also disagree that Nestle, a company that was sued earlier in the year for [profiting from child slavery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/) be given a 4.9 rating by FTSERussel and subsequently included in the [FTSE4Good Index](https://www.nestle.com/ask-nestle/health-nutrition/answers/what-is-ftse4good)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;[This study from MIT Sloan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-mit-sloan-study-discovers-widespread-and-repeated-retroactive-changes-to-esg-scores-301576360.html) shows that there are “widespread and repeated” retroactive changes to ESG scores by ESG ratings agencies in order to establish this relationship.  
&gt;  
&gt;*He explains that the data for any specific point in time should remain the same for a firm unless there is a documented reason for a retroactive change. However, their study revealed significant unannounced and unexplained changes to the data provided by* [*Refinitive ESG*](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=2880314828&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.refinitiv.com%2Fen%2Ffinancial-data%2Fcompany-data%2Fesg-data&amp;a=Refinitive+ESG)*, which was previously owned by Thomson Reuters. For example, looking at two versions of the same Refinitive ESG data for identical firm years — one from September 2018 and the other from September 2020 — the median overall scores in the rewritten data were 18% lower than in the initial data.*  
*He notes that the data rewriting occurs on an ongoing basis without any public announcements. To show this, the researchers compared ESG scores from February 9 and March 23, 2021 — just six weeks apart — and found that 85% of firms’ scores changed. While the score changes were mostly small in magnitude, the ongoing retroactive changes affected the classification of firms and the link between ESG scores and returns.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Using predictive regressions, they showed that investing in firms with higher ESG scores in the initial data would not have led to economically or statistically significant performance gains. Yet, in the rewritten data, they found economically large, statistically significant positive effects of the E&amp;S score on the firm’s future stock returns. These large differences matter because this performance would not have been possible with the data available to investors when forming their investment strategies.* 

ESG FUNDS:

&gt;*Sector exposures across the funds revealed that information technology was the largest allocation in most funds, and an almost zero allocation in energy. This was one of the key drivers behind the shorter-term recent outperformance of ESG funds relative to their non-ESG counterparts, as tech stocks rallied in 2020 whilst energy declined.*  
&gt;  
&gt;So the overperformance of ESG funds compared to a wide index was because they are tech heavy.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Google was the most commonly held stock across most funds; Alphabet Inc. was in 12 funds, with an average weight of 1.9% . The companies with the highest average weight across the funds were Apple (5.6%) and Microsoft (5.0%)*  
&gt;  
&gt;So ESG funds are basically investing in the same things that most other funds do: Tech (FAANG) and industrials, with very little, if any allocation towards energy. This is permissible by their rules because all of these companies have good ESG scores. Afterall their CEO’s don’t tweet.

&gt;  
&gt;[Prevailing wisdom for the last decade has been for investors to consistently buy the index.](https://www.silverlightinvest.com/blog/why-warren-buffett-making-argument-passive-investing)  
&gt;  
&gt;The has meant the last decade has seen a steady increase in capital away from actively managed funds and into passive index funds and ETF’s:  
&gt;  
&gt;The assets of equity index funds surpassed [actively managed funds in 2019](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/09/20/passive-overtakes-active-in-us-stock-fund-assets-morningstar/).

&gt;  
&gt;The prospects for fund managers being able to attract young investors were not looking particularly positive until they found a new target:  
&gt;  
&gt;The Socially Conscious Investor.  
&gt;  
&gt;ESG funds are largely investing in the same ways that ‘standard’ funds do. This is allowed because the structuring of the ESG metric and the altering of data by ESG ratings agencies means that fund managers are able to invest in whatever they would like.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the ESG rating of one provider doesn’t allow them to invest in the way they would like — they can simply choose another that does.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The entire point of third party ratings is that the average investor doesn't have to concern themselves with it. The judgments are abstracted away from them.   
&gt;  
&gt; Which is probably why most of the money flowing into ESG is going into active funds: 

 

&gt;Actively managed funds, and their fund managers salaries were being threatened by younger, savvy investors that might have otherwise invested into a passive index funds.  
&gt;  
&gt;These funds have figured out a way to not only bring younger investors on board, but also charge an [average 43% higher fee for ESG funds than for regular funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tidal-wave-of-esg-funds-brings-profit-to-wall-street-11615887004) It would be a very impressive feat of marketing if it wasn’t so deceptive.  
&gt;  
&gt; I’m an ethically-minded millennial investor. Instead of investing in an ESG fund I'm going with the optimal investment method of consistently buying into a passive index and then donating a portion of my gains to charity.

Facebook and Apple have been at odds for several years now; Apple announced back at WWDC 2020 that iOS would require apps to ask users to opt-in to cross-app advertising tracking. Facebook spent much of the next months speaking out against Apple's plans and predicting revenue instability due to the upcoming changes, but the feature was released in iOS 14.5 back in April of 2021. Somewhat surprisingly, though, a new report from The Wall Street Journal claims that before this all went down, Facebook and Apple were working on a partnership and revenue-sharing agreement.

According to the Journal, Apple and Facebook were considering a a subscription service that would offer an ad-free version of the platform. And since Apple takes a cut of in-app purchases, including subscriptions, it could have been a very lucrative arrangement indeed. Another arrangement that was discussed and ended up being a point of contention was Apple taking a cut of ""boosted posts,"" which essentially amounts to paying to put a post in front of a larger audience. Facebook has long considered boosted posts part of its advertising portfolio; as the Journal notes, small businesses often use boosted posts to reach more people. The issue came down to Apple saying boosts should be considered in-app purchases, which would be subject to the 30 percent revenue cut that the company takes. Facebook, on the other hand, maintained that those were advertising products which aren't subject to Apple's cut.

Since rolling out its user-tracking changes in 2021, research firm Insider Intelligence claims that 37 percent of iPhone users have opted in to letting companies track their activity across apps. Since the change went into effect, Facebook (now Meta) has seen its revenue growth shrink significantly — and last quarter, Meta reported the first revenue decline in the company's history.","facebook apple odds several years now; apple announced back wwdc 2020 ios would require apps ask users opt-in cross-app advertising tracking. facebook spent much next months speaking apple's plans predicting revenue instability due upcoming changes, feature released ios 14.5 back april 2021. somewhat surprisingly, though, new report wall street journal claims went down, facebook apple working partnership revenue-sharing agreement. according journal, apple facebook considering subscription service would offer ad-free version platform. since apple takes cut in-app purchases, including subscriptions, could lucrative arrangement indeed. another arrangement discussed ended point contention apple taking cut ""boosted posts,"" essentially amounts paying put post front larger audience. facebook long considered boosted posts part advertising portfolio; journal notes, small businesses often use boosted posts reach people. issue came apple saying boosts considered in-app purchases, would subject 30 percent revenue cut company takes. facebook, hand, maintained advertising products subject apple's cut. since rolling user-tracking changes 2021, research firm insider intelligence claims 37 percent iphone users opted letting companies track activity across apps. since change went effect, facebook (now meta) seen revenue growth shrink significantly — last quarter, meta reported first revenue decline company's history.","['Oracle', 'Reliance Industries', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'Meta', 'Apple']"

Cheers to the bull on recent market rally.

I have been on sidelines since Dec-Jan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying, but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping.

Now everything is overvalued again. Forward S&amp;P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900.

I am not an expert, but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However, it does not seem we will revisit June bottom, and that is ok, but I am hoping for a pullback in S&amp;P to below 4000.

My current plan is to start small DCA'ing next week and wait until September (most volatile month and before next fed meeting) and start buying at lump sums if S&amp;P 500 goes below 4000.

&amp;#x200B;

But are you buying (not scalping) at these levels? and if so, why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing?

1660476547,57,"Note : English is not my first language, sorry if i can't articulate my point properly.

**Background**

Early this year AT&amp;T spinoff their entertainment division, WarnerMedia to merge it with Discovery. The combined entity is now known as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

WBD started their first trading day, on April 11, 2022 closing at $24.78, but now the share price is at $13.78

**Why the stock dropping so much**

There are several reasons that might explain:

1)General market condition 

During April to July, we see a market correction across all indices, so WBD might be a victim of ""IPO"" at the wrong time.

Moreover, there seems to be general apathy toward media stocks as of right now that contributed to the price performance. You named it, from social media like Meta, Snap. Streaming co like Netflix, traditional media co like DIS, PARA, video game maker like TTWO, Ubisoft, RBLX.

2)AT&amp;T shareholder don't want to have anything to do with WBD

Most AT&amp;T shareholders are in it for the dividends, and yet WBD don't pay dividend and will likely to remain so in the few years as their priority is to reduce their leverage. So, it is likely that the stock tanked due to selling pressure from forced owner.

3)Management quality?

This is probably the major overhang. David Zaslav, the CEO seems like a capable and competent guy for the jobs, a long time veteran in media business. But unlike Disney, WarnerMedia on its own is a clusterfuck with no clear vision. Adding Discovery makes it even harder. Can Zaslav fixed it?

So far there are already questionable decisions like shutting off Batgirl when it is already finished, relaunching of new streaming services (when they have already invested billions growing HBO brand), DCEU problems, etc.

4)Very high leverage

Thanks in large part to AT&amp;T, WBD is saddled with very high level of debt. Of the $142 billion of total assets, about $53 billion is funded by debt, and total liabilities of $89 billion. To put thing into perspective, the current market cap for WBD is $33 billion. So every profit that they make, mostly will go to debt holder, instead to shareholders (yes, this is oversimplification).

5)Last result is not encouraging

The consesus estimate EPS for Q2 2022 is $0.12, yet the company record an earning loss (EPS) of $1.5

**Why this trade might work?**

1)It is cheap

Yes, a terrible investment thesis, especially when they just recorded an earning loss. All the potential synergy might never realizes, making this investment a total value trap. But again, it is cheap as of right now, and for all we know, all the bad things have already been priced in, no?

2)They have a strong collection of IP

DC Universe, Wizarding World (Harry Potter), Every shit HBO made (Game of Thrones, and i dont know), CNN, Oprah Winfrey, etc. 

Also, this can possibly makes them for prime takeover target.

Netflix prove that you need strong IP to win long term in media business, something that they severely lacks. Amazon bought MGM last years. It is no secret that big tech, whether it is Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and even Meta has lofty ambition in media industry.

3)Seems to be a favorite amongs superinvestor?

Michael Burry, David Einhorn, Seth Klarman loads up the position during Q2 2022. Buffett, bought shares in PARA, but i believe there are not much differences in business thesis between WBD and PARA.

4)Industry Tailwind

Both Disney and Netflix are planning to raise prices, signalling the priority for profits amongs media business. Cinema is making a comeback, midterm election means increasing ad spent for both parties, etc. 

An industry going back to its roots should be perfect time for David Zaslav to shine.

**What do you think?**

Personally, i have small position in the stocks. I see this as special situations where heavy selling pressure exist due to AT&amp;T shareholders selling their stake instead of business performance issue.

While high debt level is cause of some concern, they manage to lock the interest rate between 3%-5%.

Overall still manageable. Earning loss probably related to M&amp;A, and in due time should normalize to profitability.

On Sunday, the Tesla chief executive congratulated the company’s Shanghai “gigafactory” in a tweet: “Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M.”

The milestone came just a few weeks after Musk said Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., produced its 2 millionth vehicle. Tesla also has new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, which Musk in June referred to as “money furnaces.” The Shanghai factory opened in 2018, but it has been plagued by temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions and parts shortages. In July, Tesla said it delivered nearly 255,000 vehicles in the second quarter, down about 18% from the previous quarter. Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. 

When earnings were released, Musk said the company had been in “supply-chain hell for several years,” but barring a surprise, “we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.” 

In that report, Tesla said the Shanghai factory achieved “the highest vehicle production month in our history” in June.

I keep telling him to put his money in an index fund but he keeps pulling out his MBA and venture capital classes he took from Georgia tech and tells me to shut up.

Although I tell him statistically most people lose money from day trading he keeps acting like he can beat the market with individual stocks (he says that in the most literal way possible) and He’s going one step further and making a trading bot now. 

I know he’s my dad and I don’t really want to fight him but I’m really worried about him seemingly gambling away his life savings. He is soon going to retire from his data-analytics job.

And although I know that some very talented people make money out of trading bots and stuff but It really is going against traditional knowledge on how to invest as a individual.

Previously posted this on WSB and immediately got a comment to put all the money in bbby. It was fun and all but I’d really like some actual advice

Some additional context: I invest in individual stocks, bonds, and etfs. 
I am a minor and a highschooler.
My investments total around 30000$

I read different stuff like john bogle, peter lynch, graham and etc to stuff on investopia. 

my dad is a data scientist who works as a r&amp;d researcher or whatever.
He has a portfolio of like 300,000.

Another edit:
He is a investor that often swings stocks
(What I was referring to the “day trading”)

He has stuff like TSLA and google and 3M 
And lots of dividend stocks I recommended.
I just can’t get him to bury the idea of actually making a day trading bot and swing trading. 

My portfolio is 70% stocks (etfs, reits, blue chips, dividend sfocks) and 30% bonds. (Corporate&amp;treasury)


To be a little more clear:
He’s not retiring with 300k. He has real estate and if I recall correctly he has more in cash to what he has in stocks. His future plan is to expand the stock portfolio.

You keep asking me for his returns
He’s up 1% this year. So?
He got hit by the crash and bought the dip
That doesn’t mean he’s capable of making long term returns 😂

* **Burry's Scion Asset Management only held a $3.3 million stake in Geo Group, a new filing shows.**
* **Scion owned $165 million of stocks at the end of March,** ***excluding*** **its Apple put options.**

 **FULL STORY**

Michael Burry, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame, slashed his US stock portfolio to a single holding in the second quarter, a [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1649339) revealed on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosed just over 500,000 shares of Geo Group worth $3.3 million. Geo invests in private prisons and mental health facilities, and commands a market capitalization of less than $900 million.

Close followers of Burry are likely to interpret his decision to effectively liquidate his portfolio as a bad omen.

More recently, he has [cautioned investors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-consumer-recession-inflation-stock-market-rally-2022-8?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) not to get too excited about the recent rally in stocks, as previous downturns have seen [lots of temporary rebounds](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-stock-market-bubble-crash-rallies-2022-5?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) before finding a bottom.

Scion's portfolio comprised 11 stocks worth $165 million at the end of March, excluding bearish put options it held against 206,000 Apple shares.

The Scion chief has taken a knife to his portfolio in the past. He pared it from 20 holdings to six in the third quarter of last year, reducing its value from $140 million to $42 million in the space of three months.

It's hard to see AAPL moving much higher from here given the valuation and it's also hard to see the market moving much higher without AAPL.

AAPL is a great company and while I feel it deserves a slight premium to the market I'm struggling to remain bullish given the current valuation. I'm also concerned that AAPL nearing ATHs could once again be signalling peak market bullishness.

1660602980,0,"The prevailing ""wisdom"" of this sub is that TSLA is a good business with an overvalued stock. I am here to illustrate that this is not the case - the stock is not overvalued. The primary reason being, you cannot expect to pay the same earnings multiple for companies with a vastly different earnings growth trajectories. So what other company and stock can we compare that is as at the same size as Tesla with very high growth prospects and is widely considered a good business AND a good investment? Amazon!

Over the last 12 months, Tesla's earnings multiple is actually 16% lower than Amazon's, and calculated from 2023 forecasted earnings, Tesla's earnings multiple is still 3% lower than Amazon's. Amazon's earnings forecasts have been too optimistic - Amazon missed analyst estimates 3 out of the last 4 quarters, while Tesla beat analyst estimates every single quarter in the past year. Moreover, Tesla's 2023 earnings forecast has only had upwards revisions (7 of them) in the past month, while Amazon has had 5 upwards revisions and 6 downwards revisions from analysts. Finally, the range between the low and high estimates for Amazon is much wider than the range for Tesla, indicating higher earnings uncertainty. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum it up, Tesla is actually less richly valued than Amazon based on current and 2023 earnings multiples, the analysts have consistently underestimated Tesla despite revising earnings estimates up while analysts have consistently overestimated Amazon despite revising earning estimates down, and Tesla earnings are more certain than Amazon's. As a reminder, Tesla has much more room to grow with only 1.5% of the car market compared to Amazon's 40% share of online retail.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I believe that analysts are way underestimating Tesla earnings potential. Based on my own estimate, I believe Tesla will actually accomplish 2023 earnings of $23.81 per share (compare to analyst consensus of $14.51) by expanding revenue over 50% in 2023 with new factories ramped up in Berlin and Austin, gross margins well in excess of 30% due to economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies at their new factories as well as near 100% margin software sales, while operating expenses grow slower than revenue growth. If this comes to pass, and investors are willing to pay an Amazon-like earnings multiple for 2023, the stock would be worth 65.98\*$23.81= $1,570, or nearly 70% higher than it is today.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, the trend of analysts underestimating Tesla combined with Tesla's relatively reasonable valuation multiple (as discussed above) could provide a tailwind to the stock over the next 12-16 months and take it to new highs.","prevailing ""wisdom"" sub tsla good business overvalued stock. illustrate case - stock overvalued. primary reason being, cannot expect pay earnings multiple companies vastly different earnings growth trajectories. company stock compare size tesla high growth prospects widely considered good business good investment? amazon! last 12 months, tesla's earnings multiple actually 16% lower amazon's, calculated 2023 forecasted earnings, tesla's earnings multiple still 3% lower amazon's. amazon's earnings forecasts optimistic - amazon missed analyst estimates 3 last 4 quarters, tesla beat analyst estimates every single quarter past year. moreover, tesla's 2023 earnings forecast upwards revisions (7 them) past month, amazon 5 upwards revisions 6 downwards revisions analysts. finally, range low high estimates amazon much wider range tesla, indicating higher earnings uncertainty. #x200b; sum up, tesla actually less richly valued amazon based current 2023 earnings multiples, analysts consistently underestimated tesla despite revising earnings estimates analysts consistently overestimated amazon despite revising earning estimates down, tesla earnings certain amazon's. reminder, tesla much room grow 1.5% car market compared amazon's 40% share online retail. #x200b; |stock|price trailing 12 month earnings (( 2023 forecasted earnings (8/15 closing price divided ( 4 quarter results relative earnings forecast (( 2023 forecast revisions analysts last 4 weeks (( earnings forecast high estimate divided low estimate (( |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |tsla|106.66|63.95|4 earnings beats|7 revised up, 0 down|1.9| |amzn|126.71|65.98|3 earnings misses, 1 beat|5 revised up, 6 revised down|2.23| #x200b; fact, believe analysts way underestimating tesla earnings potential. based estimate, believe tesla actually accomplish 2023 earnings $23.81 per share (compare analyst consensus $14.51) expanding revenue 50% 2023 new factories ramped berlin austin, gross margins well excess 30% due economies scale manufacturing efficiencies new factories well near 100% margin software sales, operating expenses grow slower revenue growth. comes pass, investors willing pay amazon-like earnings multiple 2023, stock would worth 65.98\*$23.81= $1,570, nearly 70% higher today. #x200b; words, trend analysts underestimating tesla combined tesla's relatively reasonable valuation multiple (as discussed above) could provide tailwind stock next 12-16 months take new highs.","['Amazon', 'down|2.23|\n\n&amp;#x200B', 'Tesla']"

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street rally looks to take a breather after Dow’s 5-day winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell on Wednesday as a rally that has propelled equity prices higher since mid-June appeared poised for a respite.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 209 points, or 0.61%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.84% and 0.96%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched its fifth straight day of gains Tuesday. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is going for its fifth positive week in a row as investors continue to gauge how much strength this rally has. The broad market index is now up 18% from its June lows.
*****
&gt; “This market has been so resilient,” Brynn Talkington, managing partner of Requisite Capital Management, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “As we’re coming to a close on earnings, earnings are going to beat by a median of about 7%.”
*****
&gt; Though giving her “a great deal of pause” in this market is the Federal Reserve and its plans to continue raising rates and shrink the size of its balance sheet. “Earnings have still been strong, but…the Fed balance sheet hasn’t budged,” she said.
*****
&gt; Traders on Wednesday were looking ahead to the release of U.S. retail sales data later in the morning. In the afternoon, the Federal Reserve is slated to release the minutes from its most recent meeting.
*****
&gt; Additionally, Wall Street has been poring through corporate earnings from the retail sector. Walmart and Home Depot reported Tuesday, while Lowe’s and Target posted earnings Wednesday morning.

1660843343,41,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/qualcomm-is-plotting-a-return-to-server-market-with-new-chip](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/qualcomm-is-plotting-a-return-to-server-market-with-new-chip)

[Qualcomm Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US) is taking another run at the market for server processors, according to people familiar with its plans, betting it can tap a fast-growing industry and decrease its reliance on smartphones.

The company is seeking customers for a product stemming from last year’s purchase of chip startup Nuvia, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. [Amazon.com Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US)’s AWS business, one of the biggest server chip buyers, has agreed to take a look at Qualcomm’s offerings, they said.

Representatives for Qualcomm and Amazon declined to comment. 

Qualcomm gained as much as 2.9% to $152.91 in New York trading after Bloomberg reported the news. The shares had been down 19% this year through Wednesday, part of a broader slide for chip stocks. 

Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon is trying to turn Qualcomm into a broader provider of semiconductors, rather than just the top maker of smartphone chips. But an earlier push into the server market was abandoned four years ago under his predecessor. At the time, the company was trying to cut costs and placate investors after fending off a hostile takeover by [Broadcom Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AVGO:US)

This time around, Qualcomm has Nuvia, staffed with chip designers from companies such as [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US) Amon, who acquired the business for about $1.4 billion in 2021, has said that its work will help revitalize Qualcomm’s high-end offerings for smartphones. But Nuvia was founded as a provider of technology for the server industry.

The market for cloud computing infrastructure -- the kind of equipment that Amazon, Google and Microsoft Corp. use to whisk data around the world -- generated $73.9 billion last year, according to [research firm IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48998722). That was up 8.8% from 2020. 

The owners of giant cloud data centers have long relied on Intel Corp.’s chip technology for their servers. But they’re increasingly embracing processors that use designs from [Arm Ltd.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2243469Z:LN), a key partner in phone chips for San Diego-based Qualcomm.

Arm designs are already dominant in mobile phones, where they’re prized for not draining battery life. Now power consumption has become a more pressing issue in the data center world as well. As server farms spread -- and suck up staggering amounts of electricity -- companies want more efficient chips.

Amazon has addressed this need by building its own chips based on Arm designs. The e-commerce giant has created multiple generations of its Graviton processor line and touts its performance to customers.

But Amazon also still uses chips from [Intel](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/INTC:US), [Advanced Micro Devices Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMD:US) and [Nvidia Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US) \-- and Qualcomm sees an opportunity to carve out a niche among those suppliers.

The last time it made such an attempt was 2017, when Qualcomm began selling an Arm-based server chip called the Centriq 2400. It relied on [Samsung Electronics Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/005930:KS) to manufacture the products and said they outperformed Intel’s Xeon processors in energy efficiency and cost. At the public introduction of the server chip line in November of that year, potential customers such as [Microsoft](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) took to the stage to voice their interest in the offering.

But less than a year later, the company’s leadership began shuttering the project. Former Intel executive Anand Chandrasekher, who had led the effort, left Qualcomm.

For Intel, Qualcomm’s latest move would bring yet more competition to an industry it once dominated. The company has been racing to bolster its technology and manufacturing after losing market share to AMD and homegrown chips like Amazon’s.

For Qualcomm, a successful push into server chips would mean it has a much bigger-ticket item to sell. The company’s phone offerings are typically priced in the tens of dollars.

# The Technicals

2022's first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last 52 years. This saw the S&amp;P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

Thus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&amp;P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&amp;P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.

That said, the first half of 2022 was the worst in 52 years, the third quarter was one of the best, and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record. Here is a visual:

# 1929-crash-like Margin Deleveraging

[FINRA Margin Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.

Fibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.

FINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

Unfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&amp;P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&amp;P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history.

1660907538,5,"I want everyone to be successful and make money. All over r/stocks and other similar subs I am seeing people crying about the recent BBBY stock fiasco. Make this a reality check that if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Reminds me of when I was a gambling addict and thought I could beat the casino years ago. 

I will say what others have pointed out on this sub in the past. If you had held each of the following ETFs or stocks you would in every single situation find your money, 10 years ago to today, at least double. What I will also do is show how much money you will have in 10 years from now, assuming the same performance in the US stock market. I believe we are headed for a recession in 2023, but I also believe we will see an overall similar mid term performance between now and 2032 with the below ETFs and stocks (yes, even with Tesla). I will provide what percentage of the portfolio each ETF or stock should be, along with the past 10 year and if repeated what the next 10 year return will be (not even including dividends) if you had invested only $1,000 in 2012 AND also what your return would be if you invested only $1,000 today and wait until 2032: 

**VOO** \[40% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($129 per share) to 2022 ($393) return = 204% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($393) to 2032 with a 204% return would equate to VOO being at **$1,195** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 204% return would equate to ***$3,040*** (not including dividends) 

&amp;#x200B;

**TQQQ** \[20% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($1.17 per share) to 2022 ($37.55) return = 3,109% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($37.55) to 2032 with a 3,109% return would equate to TQQQ being at **$1,205** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 3,109% return would equate to ***$32,090*** (no dividend is paid on TQQQ) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Alphabet Class C** \[20% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($16.93 per share) to 2022 ($120.17) return = 609% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($120.17) to 2032 with a 609% return would equate to Alphabet Class C being at **$853** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 609% return would equate to ***$7,098*** (not including dividends) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Apple** \[10% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($23.69 per share) to 2022 ($174.15) return = 635% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($174.15) to 2032 with a 635% return would equate to Apple being at **$1,281** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 635% return would equate to ***$7,355*** (not including dividends) 

&amp;#x200B;

The remainder of my portfolio is made up of Tesla, Microsoft, Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and I always keep about 5% of my portfolio in cash to buy during corrections quickly. Each of these has at least a 200% return on investment (SCHD is closer to 196% but remember this is a high dividend ETF). 

This is a reality check and a reminder for us, including myself, that the best thing a person can do is put money in things like VOO, TQQQ, and other profitable mega/large cap stocks with good track records and not check them every single day or try to beat the market. The articles about dead people who were not selling in panic during the start of the pandemic make sense now. Your $1,000 put into the first 4 companies listed above ($4,000) would be **$49,583.** Even if we go into a recession, which could mean TQQQ goes down to $1 you are still going to come out on top in 10 years.

Currently its valued at around 72k and I am 25 years old (for the purpose of investing timelines).

I also hope that via META's impressive balance sheets that overtime they will reach higher stock prices again. I personally think the stock is undervalued and that the metaverse isn't necessary to succeed in order for the company to print money.

I bought QQQM towards the peak so my saltiness towards it may be unwarranted lol.

1661030260,3,"Company Analysis-DKS- Dicks Sporting Goods. 

Here is a great Company, Dicks Sporting Goods. With only 9 Billion Market Cap this thing is selling at a Big discount to Intrinsic Value. 2022 Net Income of 1.5 Billion in 2021 it is Trading at only 6 Times 2021 earnings. This company also looks out for the shareholders, Last year the Purchased 1.1 Billion dollars worth of shares and paid 600 Million in Dividends. Have the best Margins in the business. In 2021 38.33 Gross Margin, 16.55% Operating Margin. In retailing this are huge numbers. Financially the company is in great shape with 2.6 Billion in cash. 

Dicks also has great Fucking Managers, Ed Stack the Son of Dick Stack has turned this family business from a store operation to over 850 stores around the country. Ed Stack Fucks the competition for breakfast. Many sports retailers have gone under When the Giant Dicks comes to town. They are used to being the small underdogs but over the last decade they have become the biggest and best sports retailer in the country. There’s really 2 competitors left. 1 being Big 5, I’m not sure if you’ve ever been to Big 5 but we had one in my small town and it was horrible. Always more workers than costumers and never had what you wanted. THEY ARE FUCKED.  

The other competitor is ASO Academy sports and Outdoors, they are a solid competitor (Inside the state of Texas). Outside of Texas they haven’t been able to expand the brand very well. While Dicks has been able to expand in the state. So, the biggest and best retailer in the country has 1 competitor in 1 state. They have also made great strides in their online business, and have a great omnichannel. 

Looking at Big 5’s Margins last year, they were around 11.6% at operating income, while ASO was at 12.7%. With DKS margins at 16.55% this is a huge competitive advantage. Able to profit 4-5 extra dollars for every 100$ of revenue.  

DKS is also much more conservatively financed which puts them much better to handle adverse situations such as inflation,etc. For example DKS has 2.6 Billion in Cash and 2.7 Billion in current assets. Big 5 has 97 million in cash and 270 million in current assets. ASO had 486 million in cash and over 1.1 Billion in current assets. This puts Big 5 and ASO in a much more leveraged situation, where a couple bad quarters or years would really put pressure on them to either issue more shares or more debt in order to pay the bills. Dicks is a much Bigger and stronger company than their rivals. 

Dicks has also landed a major partnership with Nike to get some exclusivity on some of their products. The only negative of this company is that the sports retailing business is going to have lower revenue and profits this year. The retailing business was helped hugely by stimmy checks in 2021. However with Net income of 300 Million in 2019 and going to be around 1 Billion this year, this is still very good net income growth. The 10 years prior to 2021 their average net income increase was 19% a year on average and even if you look at 2019 and its average net income growth for 10 years it was solid with over 8%. That is still a solid growth rate for a company selling so cheap and that buys back a lot of stock. This is a company that is getting bigger and still growing at a good rate. Big 5 and ASO need to be beware: Dicks in the rearview mirror might be bigger than they appear. Dicks is coming for their ass. 

At the end of the first quarter then company had 77 Million shares outstanding. Ed Stack owns 20 Million of the shares. This is a family business he’s worked his entire life at. He ain’t FUCKING selling like Pussyboy RC I’ll tell you that. Then looking at the rest of the insiders they own another 11 Million shares. Most of them aren’t selling those either. So now were looking at a company with 44 million shares outstanding. Then if you count the 4 biggest institutional investors they own another 24 Million shares. If you count all those you’re looking at 20 Million of float, while the company buy’s back a lot of shares.  

In conclusion This is a great company at a great price that has the chance to go to the fucking moon. Already up 50% since June.","company analysis-dks- dicks sporting goods. great company, dicks sporting goods. 9 billion market cap thing selling big discount intrinsic value. 2022 net income 1.5 billion 2021 trading 6 times 2021 earnings. company also looks shareholders, last year purchased 1.1 billion dollars worth shares paid 600 million dividends. best margins business. 2021 38.33 gross margin, 16.55% operating margin. retailing huge numbers. financially company great shape 2.6 billion cash. dicks also great fucking managers, ed stack son dick stack turned family business store operation 850 stores around country. ed stack fucks competition breakfast. many sports retailers gone giant dicks comes town. used small underdogs last decade become biggest best sports retailer country. there’s really 2 competitors left. 1 big 5, i’m sure you’ve ever big 5 one small town horrible. always workers costumers never wanted. fucked. competitor aso academy sports outdoors, solid competitor (inside state texas). outside texas haven’t able expand brand well. dicks able expand state. so, biggest best retailer country 1 competitor 1 state. also made great strides online business, great omnichannel. looking big 5’s margins last year, around 11.6% operating income, aso 12.7%. dks margins 16.55% huge competitive advantage. able profit 4-5 extra dollars every 100$ revenue. dks also much conservatively financed puts much better handle adverse situations inflation,etc. example dks 2.6 billion cash 2.7 billion current assets. big 5 97 million cash 270 million current assets. aso 486 million cash 1.1 billion current assets. puts big 5 aso much leveraged situation, couple bad quarters years would really put pressure either issue shares debt order pay bills. dicks much bigger stronger company rivals. dicks also landed major partnership nike get exclusivity products. negative company sports retailing business going lower revenue profits year. retailing business helped hugely stimmy checks 2021. however net income 300 million 2019 going around 1 billion year, still good net income growth. 10 years prior 2021 average net income increase 19% year average even look 2019 average net income growth 10 years solid 8%. still solid growth rate company selling cheap buys back lot stock. company getting bigger still growing good rate. big 5 aso need beware: dicks rearview mirror might bigger appear. dicks coming ass. end first quarter company 77 million shares outstanding. ed stack owns 20 million shares. family business he’s worked entire life at. ain’t fucking selling like pussyboy rc i’ll tell that. looking rest insiders another 11 million shares. aren’t selling either. looking company 44 million shares outstanding. count 4 biggest institutional investors another 24 million shares. count you’re looking 20 million float, company buy’s back lot shares. conclusion great company great price chance go fucking moon. already 50% since june.","['ASO Academy', 'Dicks', 'Fucking Managers', 'Intrinsic Value', 'the Giant Dicks', 'DKS', 'Nike', 'Tesla', 'ASO', 'Dicks Sporting Goods']"

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Monday following a halt in the summer rally last week, as fears of aggressive interest rate hikes returned to Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 321 points, or by 0.95%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.22% and 1.57%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as European markets experienced steep declines, driven in part by worries of rising inflation and higher interest rates around the world.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed down 1.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 292 points, or 0.86%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01%. The major averages also posted weekly losses.
*****
&gt; Investors are anticipating what could be a volatile week of trading ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s latest comments on inflation at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; “Fed Chair Powell is likely to sound meaningfully more hawkish during his Jackson Hole speech on Friday morning at 10am ET than he did at his July 27th press conference, when he said the fed funds rate is already back to neutral,” according to a Monday report from Wolfe Research’s Chris Senyek.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front, traders are expecting Palo Alto Networks and Zoom Video to report results Monday after the bell.

Here are 5 reasons to buy Teradyne $TER at $94.

**Duopoly**

The semi test equipment industry is largely a duopoly, controlled by $TER and its largest competitor Advantest. Barriers to entry are high and projects have long gestation periods

**High Growth**

The semi conductor industry has been growing at double digits and is expected to grow in the high single digits over the next decade, ensuring $TER a fairly sustainable and steady source of revenue.

**Very Profitable**

$TER earns an operating profit of about 30% of revenues, which are among the best in the industry and protect it from downturns like the current one.

**The Robotics Division is growing fast at 35% a year.** 

Still a small segment of total revenues, this division should boost revenues and earnings over the next 10 Years.

For 2022, earnings should drop 36% and revenues 17%. However, $TER expects to double earnings to about $8 a share from the current $4 by 2024, which gives it a **2 Year Forward PE of only 11.7**.

# [U.S. stock futures are higher after Dow, S&amp;P 500 break three-day slide](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/us-stock-futures-flat-after-dow-sp-500-break-three-day-slide-.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher Thursday morning after all three major averages ended higher during the daily trading session.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 118 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Snowflake jumped 17% after posting a beat on revenue. Shares of Nvidia slid 4% on the heels of a quarterly report that missed Wall Street’s expectations. Salesforce fell more than 6% after the company provided a disappointing forecast for fiscal 2023.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Wednesday rose slightly along with the S&amp;P 500. For both averages, the gains snapped three-day long losing streaks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also ticked up 0.41%.
*****
&gt; The market action took place as investors await the start of the Jackson Hole economic symposium, which begins Thursday with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to speak the following morning. Traders will be listening for more information about how the central bank will combat high inflation and if policymakers may cut rates when the current hiking cycle is over.
*****
&gt; “It’s steady as it goes, it’s way too early for the Fed to consider a pivot,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, on CNBC’s “Fast Money.”
*****
&gt; Investors are also waiting for key economic reports scheduled to come out later in the week, including jobless claims Thursday and the personal consumption expenditures Friday. The PCE report is one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, and it could influence its actions going forward.
*****
&gt; Peloton reports quarterly earnings Thursday before the bell, along with Gap, Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Ulta Beauty, Workday and Affirm Holdings will release their own results after markets close Thursday.

#[Stock futures slip ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower on Friday, dimming hopes that the S&amp;P 500 could grind out another positive week.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded 0.4% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed an up day for the major averages in which the Dow jumped about 300 points, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, advancing 1.7% as a pullback in yields helped tech shares.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it remains a really attractive moment to invest in equities. Underlying company performance is strong for the highest quality companies, and multiples are down because of macro fears. That’s the setup every long-term investor looks for,” Robert Cantwell, a portfolio manager at Upholdings, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Nevertheless, all the major averages are on pace for their second straight down week. The Dow is on track for a 1.2% decline. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are heading to slightly smaller declines of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on Powell’s widely anticipated 10 a.m. ET speech at the central bank’s annual symposium in Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Investors are hoping for new guidance about how the Fed will act this autumn, but expectations are lower, with many expecting Powell to reiterate the Fed’s promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates. Opinion’s divided on whether the Fed will bump rates by half a percentage point or three quarters of a point at its next policy meeting in September.
*****
&gt; The personal consumption expenditures, one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, will also be watched ahead of Powell’s speech Friday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’re likely to see a relief tomorrow unless we get a big shock from what Powell says,” Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “One thing I would keep an eye out on if we look to next week and into the fall… implied bond volatility is still very, very high for where it normally is in late August, suggesting that actually we’re likely to continue seeing a lot of action in the yield curve, which could affect stock markets in the fall.”

1661546226,19,"Electronic Art's stock was up 4% today because of an unconfirmed report that Amazon will be acquiring the company. I'm not clear if Amazon will move forward with the bid, but I'm not surprised that Electronic Arts will be acquired sooner rather than later. We already know that Apple, Disney, Amazon, and NBCUniversal have been discussing acquiring the company since May '22. There are also other big tech players like Meta, Google, Nvidia, Netflix, and Nike who are potential suitors given their aspirations for the metaverse, they already missed out on Activision Blizzard after agreeing to be acquired by Microsoft, and there is a low supply of targets with the customer base &amp; intellectual property that EA has to help them reach their metaverse goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Two key takeaways:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to my analysis, a fair value (*yellow*) would be at least **+$173/share or +30% upside** from today's price. That would be consistent with EA's FY '23 EBITDA guidance for **+$2,400m** and a **20.0x** multiple for a software company that is growing the top-line by high single-digits and +30% EBITDA margins.

&amp;#x200B;

* ATVI was acquired by Microsoft for a **17.5x** multiple. Applying that same multiple to EA's EBITDA guidance (*blue*) would imply **$150/share or +13% upside** from today's price. In my view, that **17.5x** multiple for EA is the **floor** because ATVI merited a lower multiple given internal scandals and declining performance for Call of Duty.","electronic art's stock 4% today unconfirmed report amazon acquiring company. clear amazon move forward bid, surprised electronic arts acquired sooner rather later. already know apple, disney, amazon, nbcuniversal discussing acquiring company since may '22. also big tech players like meta, google, nvidia, netflix, nike potential suitors given aspirations metaverse, already missed activision blizzard agreeing acquired microsoft, low supply targets customer base intellectual property ea help reach metaverse goals. #x200b; extra background ea's potentially acquired: ( link sensitivity analysis possible valuations ea: ( #x200b; two key takeaways: #x200b; * according analysis, fair value (*yellow*) would least **+$173/share +30% upside** today's price. would consistent ea's fy '23 ebitda guidance **+$2,400m** **20.0x** multiple software company growing top-line high single-digits +30% ebitda margins. #x200b; * atvi acquired microsoft **17.5x** multiple. applying multiple ea's ebitda guidance (*blue*) would imply **$150/share +13% upside** today's price. view, **17.5x** multiple ea **floor** atvi merited lower multiple given internal scandals declining performance call duty.","['Microsoft', 'EA', 'Amazon', 'Walt Disney', 'kotaku.com.au)](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/05', 'Call of Duty', 'Nike', 'Meta', 'Apple', 'Electronic Arts', 'Google', 'NBCUniversal']"

1661628809,85,"Ok. I rode the rally up from June low on 50% cash but now I'm thinking of selling all my MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA ASML LRCX etc till we get to sp500 2000 or so.

I just don't see the point in holding my MSFT and stuff.

I got in MSFT at $220 and my AAPL is basis $103 but I feel by October MSFT will be at $150 and AAPL will be at $80 or less so I'd rather get out now.

I'm still negative so I'll have no tax consequences, but I'll have wash sales but that's no.biggie for me.

I'll keep my UNH since I'm up 54% since buying it 1.6 years ago and probably keep things like UNP NEE COST and my ENPH.

So anyone else selling all their tech?

I just think MSFT and AAPL will be going down at ver least 50% so why lose money when I can just buy in lower?

I like MSFT and AAPL, but I think tech will get crushed now.

1661699507,154,"Peloton has been a public company for less than 3 years and its share price has been all over the place. It is now down over 90% since its all-time high back at the end of December 2022 and the volatility has been crazy.

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals, lay down some assumptions about the future, and value the company as a whole.

Feedback is always welcomed!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Peloton?**

In a nutshell, it is a company that's making money by offering:

\- Connected fitness products - Exercise equipment (bikes, treads, and soon rowing machines)

\- Subscriptions - Media content related to fitness (pilates, strength training, stretching, yoga, meditation)

\- Fitness apparel (insignificant in terms of revenue at this very moment)

&amp;#x200B;

**The hype**

As we all know, the pandemic caused this company's share price to go through the roof. The demand for their products skyrocketed thanks to the lockdown and the media coverage of their products.

***Connected fitness products***

The revenue of their connected fitness products grew from $734m in 2019 to $1,5b in 2020 (99% growth) to $3,2b in 2021 (115% growth).

*\*Note - Their fiscal year ends 30 June, hence, 2021 is the year starting July 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2021.*

However, these products are generally considered more premium/luxury. For the same amount of money, one can subscribe to a budget-level gym for roughly 10 years and have access to a lot more equipment.

During this period, the gross margin that they had on these products was around 40%, which is quite high for a company in this industry, but the increased demand did its job well.

Until 2022 started and the growth was nowhere to be found. The revenue declined to $2,2b (-31%) and the decline was over 50% if the last quarter was to be compared year over year.

Not only that, but the gross margin was -11%. No, it is not a typo, they lost money on the sale of these products.

When there's a huge decline in the level of demand, it has a huge impact on the prices (Economics 101). Of course, the tough part was to estimate the level of demand for the coming period with all the uncertainty.

In 2022, the management put a lot of capital into inventory to meet the demand, which wasn't as high as before. So, at the end of 2022 (As of June 30th), there's roughly $1.1b in inventory. That's roughly 50% of all the sales they made in the entire last year. As the prices decline, they had to take impairment for some of these products.

***Subscriptions***

This, in my opinion, is their cash cow segment. It has been growing from $181m in 2019 to $364m in 2020 (101%) to $872m in 2021 (140%) to $1,4b in 2022 (60%).

The gross margin improved from 43% to 68% during the same period.

It seems that the company is more focused on selling connected fitness products as a way to reach out to its target customers and actually make money on the subscriptions.

&amp;#x200B;

**The other operating costs**

If we combine both revenue sources together, the total revenue for the last 12 months was $3,6b with a thin gross margin of 19% (gross margin of close to $700m).

Every young company is known for incurring losses due to heavy spending on Research &amp; Development and Sales &amp; Marketing that would allow them to grow fast. In that respect, Peloton is no different.

In 2022, the spendings were as follows:

1. Sales &amp; Marketing - $1b
2. General &amp; Administrative - $1b
3. Research &amp; Development - $360m

It is quite clear that the gross profit of $700m is not sufficient to cover these main operating expenses. Peloton lost over $1.6b from its operations (-46% operating margin). This is not that surprising as the majority of the high-growth companies are losing money due to the higher than average spending on Sales &amp; Marketing and Research &amp; Development. However, when the growth is no longer there, that's when it becomes ugly. In addition, I was not impressed by the level of R&amp;D spending as Peloton's long-term success is highly dependent on its innovation.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's not all. They had 3 ""one-time expenses"" during the year:

1. Impairments - $562m - Mainly related to goodwill, part as mentioned above to inventories
2. Supplier settlements - $338m - Based on the information available, it relates to the settlement of litigation with iFIT
3. Restructuring - $181m - As the demand falls, the number of employees is reduced

It could be argued that these are one-time expenses (as they were non-existent in the past), however, as the demand is falling and their inventory levels are high, it would not be surprising if there are further impairments, further restructuring, and who knows whether there will be further supplier settlements. If we take all of this into account, the operating loss of the company was -2,7b (-76% operating margin).

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

On the balance sheet, apart from the high inventory levels mentioned above, there's around $1.3b in cash. Although on its own is a big number, it doesn't seem so big when we take into account the last year's losses company had. If the margins don't improve dramatically, they will be raising capital during the next 6-12 months.

They already have a debt of $2,4b (for comparison purposes, their market cap is $3,6b) so they're in a tough position.

&amp;#x200B;

**Striking deal with Amazon**

In the last 7 days, there were 2 huge headlines. The first one was the deal that Peloton announced that part of their products will be available for purchase in Amazon US stores.

The share price went up around 20%.

Only a few days later, they shared the 2022 earnings and the share price returned to the same levels.

This is a great example of how short-sighted the market can be at times. The deal with Amazon could be a great way to dispose of a large portion of the inventory that's just sitting there, but Amazon will take its share. That means Peloton's margins are not going to be as high (let's not forget, they're already losing money on their connected fitness products).

The more important question is, is there going to be increased demand for their products, regardless of whether they're being sold through Amazon or direct to the final consumer?

&amp;#x200B;

**The key assumptions about the future &amp; valuation**

If we take a look at the analysts' expectations regarding next year's revenue, it ranges from $2,29b for the entire year (-36% compared to 2022) to $5,82b (+63% compared to 2022). This huge expectations gap shows the uncertainty around the company.

My personal views are that the Amazon deal will help their connected fitness products to not have a significant revenue decline, while the subscription revenue is still growing strong. However, I don't expect their operating margin to improve significantly in the next year.

Hence, my assumptions are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

||2023|2024 to 2027|2028 to 2032|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|\-5% decline|5% growth / year|3% growth / year|
|Operating margin|\-20%|slowly improve to 5%|slowly improve to 15%|

My expectations are that the company has to focus more on cost-cutting and less on significantly growing revenue (other than their subscription revenue)

Discount rate: 8% today, increasing to 8.8% in 10 years

Based on those assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to $1,2b (**$3.48/share)**

The current market cap is $3,58b ($10,61/share)

*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.*

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 39% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 15%.

I am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|10%|15%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|24% ($4,4b)|\-$1.9|$2.7|$7.2|
|39% ($5,0)|\-$1.6|$3.5|$8.5|
|192% ($10,5b)|$1.3|$11.3|$21.4|
|300% ($14,3b)|$3.2|$16.7|$30.3|

&amp;#x200B;

This table illustrates well how important it is for Peloton to cut costs and improve margin. In some cases, the fair value of the company is even negative, meaning it's not worth anything! Of course, one can argue that those assumptions are too pessimistic, but there is a chance that it plays out.

Of course, if they manage to grow 300% in the next 10 years (which is the assumption of the most optimistic analyst) and on top they improve the operating margin to 20%, there's 3x upside.

However, that means Peloton will need to bring $14,3b in revenue in 10 years. Just for comparison purposes, the total gym revenue in the US is $32b/year. This is a mature market, so growth is not expected.

Let's not forget that the share price at the peak of the hype was over $160/share. If that seems crazy, it is only because it was crazy! To justify a price of $160/share, Peloton needs to bring in 2x the revenue of all US gyms combined and have a higher operating margin than 25%.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, you buy $1000 of AAPL with your own cash.
Then you borrow $500 on margin and take $500 out of this account as cash. You pay low interest rate on $500(slightly higher than treasury rate)

Then AAPL drops by 60% and your account is now worth $400.

Interest on high beta stocks will be lower than interest on low beta stocks. Since all users are selecting stocks more or less randomly, in total they will approximate SPX.

Most brokers would have issued a margin call, but hybrid loan would provide $400(fully collateralized at low interest) + $100(unsecured at relatively high interest but still much lower than credit cards because broker will be able to buy SPX puts against multiple portfolios at the same time to limit their own risk).

They can also give an option to combine HELOC into the same portfolio to automate pulling/pushing from it as price changes to decrease interest even more.

The Shift Group ($SHYF) is a company that manufacturers chassis for specialty vehicles and assemblies for the commercial vehicle (including last-mile delivery, specialty service and vocation-specific upfit segments) and recreational vehicle industries.  They've been in business since 1975.  They split their business into two reportable segments: Fleet Vehicles and Services (‘‘FVS’’) and Specialty Vehicles (‘‘SV’’), and they own: Utilimaster, Royal Truck Body, DuraMag, Blue Arc, Magnum, Strobes-R-Us, Spartan RV Chassis, and Builtmore Contract Manufacturing.  Commercial vehicles are sold under the Aeromaster®, Velocity, Trademaster®, and Utilivan® product brand names.  The industry sector is cyclical, but they report that their diversification across several sub-sectors reduces the overall risk becuase of the various markets served tend to have different cyclicality.

They've recently introduced Blue Arc, a division that is building is a complete battery-electric, Class 3 truck.  As of this writing and with production planned to start on 2023, they are the only company specifically in the Class 3 EV Chassis environment.   Class 3 vans weigh 10,001 to 14,000 pounds and have additional licensing requirements over Class 2 vehicles.  In general, they are designed to last 15 years or more and meet warehouse dock heights for loading and unloading.

The FVS segment accounts for 66% of the sales, while the SV segement makes up the other 34%.  Over the past five years sales have increased by $587.6 million, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.2%, while income from continuing operations has grown by $52.5 million, a CAGR of 41.4%, and Adjusted EBITDA has grown by $76.4 million, a CAGR of 35.9%.

On February 1, 2020, they completed the sale of their Emergency Response Vehicle (ERV) business.  In September 2020, that deal was finalized with a recognized loss on sale of $3.3m for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The ERV business included operations in Charlotte, Michigan, and operations in Brandon, South Dakota; Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; and Ephrata, Pennsylvania.  This segment had been a losing proposition for a number of years.

**Specific Risk Factors to the business**:

* **Concentrated customer base/sales**: In 2021, Amazon accounted for 25.1 percent of consolidated sales. Their top 10 customers accounted for 60.6 percent of sales.  I believe they are diversifying their customer base, but as I'm writing this I am struggling to find the numbers to support my memory.

* **Implementing a New Information Technology System**: short-term issue.  Multiple locations are being upgrade to a new system.  It could affect production if something goes catastrophically wrong.  Having been through bad ERP software changes, I think this a low risk to the long-term.

* **Supply Chain Disruption**: This is simply a problem for everyone right now.  If they somehow fall behind as things improve in the future, then this could be a serious issue.

* **Rising Interest Rates and Material Costs**: Aluminum and energy costs are increasing.  At this time analysts are projecting decreased EPS in 2023.  It could be a rough 12-24 months in the market as a result.  This is not really a problem for a long-term investor.  Could be more of an opporuntity if it comes to that.

**Some of the numbers**:

* Market Cap:	873.23M (current)

* PE Ratio:	20.92 (current)

* PS Ratio:	0.88 (current)

* P/FCF:  34.03 (as of 12/2021)

   * Free cash flow in the first two quarters of 2022 have declined, however, this seems to be an annual trend.  I believe they front load some of their annual cash outflows.  I'm still working on this hypothesis.

* Current Ratio:	1.74 (current)

* Quick Ratio:	0.56 (current)

* Debt / Equity:	0.58 (current)

* ROE:	17.60%

* ROA:	9.30%

* ROIC:	17.20%

**Thesis**

This company has very little debt and nearly $1billion in sales backlog.  This is a 100% increase since the prior year with a 46.7% increase in Revenue YoY.  I believe it is well positioned in the inflationary environment we find ourselves in.  I believe they have brand recognition in their sector, and  a first mover advantage in the subset of Class 3 EV vehicles.  They have a tremendous capital allocator in CEO Daryl Adams.  He has laid out a sold plan for this company since coming on board (this is also a weakness to the thesis, if he leaves).


A Value Investors Club write up by a long-time member states, *""Growth in the size of major fleet cariers from 250,000 units in 2020 to 450,000 in 2025.(12% CAGR). The growth is from a 100k retiring/replacement cycle and 200k market growth. This is all per a comissioned 'third party study'.

This leads me to believe they are positioned to take advantage of this projected growth.  Optimistically, they'll increase their market share.

**Valuation**

I have two simplified valuations that put the current intrinsic value between $32-$40 per share.  Due to my inexperience I apply a \~40% margin of safety, which puts it at a buy between around $20.00 to $24.00 per share.

The company is currently appealing the outcome of its battle with Fortnite developer Epic Games. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit when the judge declared that Apple was not acting as a monopolist, the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple’s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases. The ruling would bring about significant changes to the App Store by making it easier for software developers to circumvent Apple’s payment system for in-game purchases.

1661855480,2311,"**ZACKS**

**TLDR**

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  


I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. 

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   
2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   
2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   
5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   
8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  


7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

I have come across a ""Special Situation"" in the broadcasting sector, Saga Communications. Below is my investment memo. Remember, do your own diligence, this isn't investment advice.

**Saga Communications (SGA: NASDAQ)**

Date 8/30/2022

Current Price: $28

Target Price: $36.95

Implied Upside: 34%

&amp;#x200B;

**Abstract and Investment Thesis**

**Abstract**

I believe Saga Communications (SGA) which currently trades at $28/share is undervalued. My target price of $36.95 implies a 34% upside.

SGA shares are attractively priced given the following catalysts:

Super voting control by the former CEO has been terminated due to his passing

Dual share class has collapsed into one share class

Near-term revenue growth driven by mid-term political advertising spend

**Investment Thesis**

Given the above catalysts, I believe SGA is uniquely situated for an activist investor to emerge or a competitor to acquire the company in the near-term.

**COMPANY BACKGROUND**

Saga Communications, Inc. is a broadcast company whose business is primarily devoted to acquiring, developing, and operating radio stations. Saga currently owns or operates broadcast properties in 27 markets, including 79 FM and 35 AM radio stations. Saga Communications is located in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan.

Saga's strategy is to operate top billing radio stations in mid-sized markets, defined as markets ranked (by market revenues) from 20 to 200. Saga's radio stations employ a myriad of programming formats, including Active Rock, Adult Album Alternative, Adult Contemporary, Country, and others.

Saga began operations in 1986 and became a publicly traded company in December 1992.

SGA employs 570 full-time individuals and 227 part-time individuals.

SGA owns and operates over 100 radio licenses.

SGA operates in 27 markets including: Columbus, Milwaukee, Norfolk, Des Moines, Charleston, and Ocala FL.

**COMPANY BACKGROUND**

Saga decentralizes the corporate brand from each local station. This allows the local stations to build their own brand outside of the corporate enterprise and create long-term community goodwill in their respective cities.

In addition to the decentralized corporate enterprise, Saga focuses on winning local advertisement accounts over national advertising accounts. In larger markets, national advertising is less personable as the ad accounts will come from well established companies like General Motors, Apple and Proctor and Gamble.

Focusing on local advertising gives the Saga team an opportunity to build a reputation with small businesses — establishing community goodwill. This decentralized system has given the Company a competitive advantage over larger radio companies in the area who tend to focus more on larger national accounts.

The Company has consistently generated \~$125 million in revenues, \~$25 million in EBITDA and \~$20 million in free cash flow.

Saga Communications operates radio stations in the top 30 – 200 markets. SGA markets are located in the Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast.

Within SGA’s top seven markets, their radio stations are ranked from 1st to 5th in listenership (Nielsen's Audio Ranking).

Of SGA’s 100+ radio licenses, 33 were up for renewal in 2022. These licenses have either been re-granted or are pending approval by the FCC. All other SGA licenses expire in 2027, 2028, or 2029.

**MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW**

Edward Christian was the CEO of Saga Communications for over 2 decades before he passed away in August 2022.

Warren Lada: Interim CEO. Formerly COO of Saga Communications and a current board member.

Samuel Bush: CFO. Has been with the company for over a decade.

Christopher Forgy: SVP Operations

**MARKET OVERVIEW**

SGA operates in the radio sector. Radio listenership has remained consistent up until 2020. In 2020, 83% of Americans ages 12 or older listened to terrestrial radio in a given week, a figure that dropped slightly from 89% in 2019. The decrease coincided with a sharp decrease in automobile use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 244.5 million American adults listen to the radio each month. Audiences are becoming more diverse with more than 45 million Hispanic listeners and more than 35 million Black listeners a month.

Competitors include: Townsquare Media, Audacy, Cumulus, iHeart, Spanish broadcasting, and others.

Broadcasting companies can only own up to 8 stations within a specific market. FCC licenses are granted based upon a two-step renewal process. The FCC must find the radio license was used to serve the public interest and secondly no serious violations occurred.

Marketing analytics firm Cross Screen Media had been projecting a bullish $8.8 billion in advertising buys for the 2022 midterms (by way of comparison, spending was $9.5 billion during the 2020 presidential election and $3.9 billion for the 2018 midterms).

As of August 1st, 2022, $3.6bn has been spent on mid-term elections.

Radio advertising spend has totaled $100m as of August.

**GROWTH DRIVERS (Catalysts)**

**Super voting control by the former CEO has been terminated due to his passing**

Ed Christian held 100% of SGA’s Class B stock. Class B stock had super voting control. This allowed Ed to control all company and board decisions.

Class A shares received 1 vote per share. Class B shares received 10 votes per share.

Upon the death of Ed Christian, his Class B shares will transition to Class A shares, thus dissolving the dual classes and super voting control.

**Dual share class has collapsed into one share class**

The radio sector has historically had a dual share class and super voting structure.

SGA will now be one of the only radio stocks with a single share class and no super voting control.

With a single share class and no super-voting control, SGA is ripe for an activist investor to take a position or for an acquisition by other media companies or PE.

Townsquare Media: TSQ has two classes of shares with Class B receiving 10 votes pers share.

Cumulus: Class A and Class B stock.

Audacy: Class A, B, and C stock.

iHeart Radio: Class A and Class B stock.

**Near-term revenue growth driven by mid-term political advertising spend**

Mid-term elections are held in November 2022.

Political advertising spend is expected to top the 2018 mid-terms and 2020 presidential election.

Mid-term elections drive increased local advertising spend more than national.

Sinclair, Townsquare, Cumulus, and others have signaled strong Q3 and Q4 numbers driven by political revenue in recently earnings calls.

**FINANCIALS**

Annual revenue peaked in 2016 at $142m. In 2020, revenue declined significantly to $95m.

Radio listenership is highly tied to automobile use. With no one driving in 2020, it caused advertising revenue to decline.

Annual revenue has since recovered in 2021 and 2022.

Total gross revenue resulting from national advertising in fiscal 2021 was approximately $13,138,000 or 12% of SGA’s gross revenue

Revenue has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Digital revenue has grown from $3.7m in 2019 to $6.3m in 2021. 2022 is projected to generate $8.7m.

Edward Christian’s average annual cash compensation was: $2.1m (Interim CEO salary of $750K).

SGA’s annual historic SG&amp;A was $10m. A reduction of Edward’s salary will have a significant and immediate impact on EBITDA.

EPS has historically been positive up to 2020. EPS has since recovered.

SGA has no long-term debt: “On October 27, 2021, we used $10 million from funds generated by operations to voluntarily pay down the remaining amount on our Revolving Credit Facility.”

SGA has $54m in cash.

SGA pays, on average, a $.20 cent quarterly dividend.

**INVESTMENT THESIS**

I believe SGA is situated for an activist investor or acquisition in the near-term.

The collapse of dual share classes and removal of super-voting control opens SGA to new investors.

SGA’s fixed assets generate significant free cash flow and with zero debt, SGA could be appealing for PE or a competitor to acquire them.

SGA’s largest shareholder is Towerview LLC at 22%. Towerview could acquired SGA or force a sales process.

Towerview is 100% controlled by the Tisch family. The Tisch family own the Loews Hotel company along with a variety of other companies and the New York Giants (net worth is $6bn). Towerview LLC is managed by Daniel Tisch. Saga Communications is the second largest holding of Towerview LLC.

With super-voting control dissolved, it opens a variety of ways management, or an activist investor could generate value:

Issue a special dividend

Restart their share repurchase program

Increase their own M&amp;A activity

Dividend recap

Sale lease back on towers and real estate

Increase their quarterly dividend

**VALUATION &amp; COMPS**

SGA currently trades evenly to its sector peers and certain median multiples. SGA is trading on a lower EV/EBITDA multiple compared to peers and the sector. SGA trades at a 20% discount on a median TTM EV/EBITDA multiple compared to radio peer comps.

SGA is also one of the only radio stocks to pay a dividend.

SGA’s share priced increased 12%+ on August 19th due to the CEO passing.

The median EV/EBITDA multiple for acquisitions is 8.5x. This is based on historical transactions.

I used a Sum of the Parts analysis to value Saga Communications. I came to a value through splitting the parts into the operating business, real estate, and towers. Radio stocks have typically been valued based on an EV/EBITDA multiple. SGA’s current market cap is $165m.

Using historical data, I projected revenue to reach $117m in 2022 and EBITDA to reach $23.5m.

I used SGA’s current land value, building value, and tower value. SGA’s land value has most likely not been grossed up to reflect today’s value. I assumed SGA’s buildings are overvalued due to their age. I assumed SGA’s tower value is undervalued based on historic transaction comps. I removed Equipment, furniture, and vehicles from my valuation

**Downside Risk**

If no catalyst emerges driving SGA’s share price upward, the downside risk is low.

Downside risk is mitigated by potentially robust political revenue in Q3 and Q4, and the stock’s 100 day moving average of $23.97. This implies a downside of 13%.

Saga Communications traded between $30-$35/share in 2019 before COVID. Since Oct 2020, SGA has been on an upward trend.

**INVESTMENT MERITS &amp; RISKS**

**Merits**

Experienced management team.

Strong business fundamentals.

Political advertising cycle in the near-term.

Only radio stock with one share class.

Termination of super-voting control.

Private equity dry powder is higher than any point in history.

Historic consolidation in the radio sector.

**Risks**

Macro environment continues to worsen. A recession decreases advertising/marketing spend.

Private equity lags public markets and could significantly scale back M&amp;A activity.

Rate increase will increase the cost of debt.

Interim CEO transitions to FT CEO.

Management and board don’t act and let the interim CEO run the business as before.

Radio continues to slowly lose advertising dollar share.

Digital revenue grows slower than expected and doesn’t make up for lost Radio revenue.

Low trading volume. Average daily volume is 10K shares. Large purchases could have a significant impact on our entry and exit price.

1661895982,7,"I will make this post short and to the point: Good luck trying to beat the market by doing day or swing trading. I know people who try to do this full time who are smart and have the financial means to buy up tens of thousands of dollars of stock to try and buy then sell shortly after. Every single one of these people has a net loss from starting this. There are 14 of them I know - not a single one has come out ahead. Talk about not beating the odds. 

Here is the truth r/stocks folks: If you and I were bickering back in ***May 2002*** that AAPL would be dipping from its high of **$0.45** we would have been right. AAPL did in fact go down to **$0.33** in ***July 2002.*** Had you bought puts on AAPL at the right time in 2002 - yay for you. If you had tried to swing trade AAPL in 2002 you would have probably gotten burnt, but maybe not. 

Listen: The fact is the best thing you could have done is to have poured $1,000 into AAPL at anytime in 2002 and held for the next 20 years until today, even with AAPL taking a dip recently. You would have more than 300X you original cash invested. 

We can do the same thing with the more conservative way of investing, ETFs, since most experienced investors on r/stocks like these more than individual stocks (including myself). Let us take a look at a popular ETF you and I would know as SPY. SPY right now is worth $398. Sure, SPY was at $474 back in December 2021 and man it should ""would have been nice to have sold then"". . . ***April 2002 SPY trading at $119. December 2002 $87.*** 

My point with this post is simple: Buy, hold and enjoy your life. I am not saying buy and hold crappy high risk companies. Pour 75% of your portfolio in things like SPY, VOO and QQQ and don't touch them for decades. Hell, don't even look at them. 

Current positions:

1661906576,104,"Tesla has the ambitious plan of selling 20 million cars year after year starting from 2030, the amount of lithium that you need to sell that many cars is about 1,2 million tons of lithium and the amount of lithium that we were expected to have by 2030 is anywhere from 1.8 to 1.9 million tons of lithium. that measure can easily be estimated based on current reserves, upcoming projects and battery recycling.

The leading researcher in the mineral space for electric vehicles benchmark minerals intelligence estimates that we will only have one 1.8 million tons of lithium by 2030. 

Lithium extraction is not something that can be fast tracked it actually takes on average 7 to 10 years to bring lithium from the ground into the markets, in 2019 we only mined under 400,000 tons of lithium.

Every car manufacturer globally is planning on selling tens of millions of electric cars, Tesla is really the only car manufacturer that has a supply chain figure it out and can source as much Lithium as it can get his hands on, where will the rest of other car manufacturer source enough lithium?

We will be faced with a massive Lithium shortage, lithium is already becoming the new oil and when we couple the fact that there will be a massive shortage for electric vehicles and energy storage the vast amount of wealth that will be generated in the future in my humble opinion is from Junior mining companies. China is way ahead of the United States and has recognized this problem which is why they have invested heavily into mining in other countries.

The money that is made in this electric vehicle revolution are from the companies that own the land and mine for the most important commodity of our green revolution future, lithium. Not from the electric car companies themselves. 

Companies like Sigma lithium, liontown resources, lake resources, are surging thousands of percent without even having extracted one grain of lithium. When they start to sell lithium they will take off even further.

There are a ton of Junior companies out there that have massive potential in my humble opinion the best ones are Brazil Minerals, Sayona mining, Atlantic lithium, lake resources, Piedmont lithium. 


To those of you who think there is a replacement technology, there’s no replacement technology that can be brought to market within the next 15 to 20 years, let alone a replacement technology we still haven’t even figured out how to deliver solid-state batteries to market. It’s one thing to create a new technology and another to commercialize it.

Did tons of macro economic research in the last two weeks, stared at charts to watch volume and understand market sentiment, checking 1s order sizes to see larger players enter or exit, etc.

I timed the top of the market when I saw AMZN  (and the rest of the market) do a quick jitter down on the day of the top. Other people noticed it too but brushed it off. The medium sized sell made the price of AMZN, QQQ, SPY, etc move down way too much for the size of the liquidation. I took this as a sign of the market being very fragile and oversold so I sold all my AMZN (with margin).

Next day, market started it’s descent. This caused me to do all the aforementioned research because I’ve lost my money before on the first 2022 crash and I understand how important capital protection is now. I decided to be bearish on the market as a whole.

I decided that Jackson hole speech would be a catalyst for a huge change in the markets because of what the fed was saying vs how the greedy market was acting and not believing the fed and how they were pricing in a fantasy. Blackrock convinced me a bit too, since I’m sure they would be greedy if the risk was low, but they were ultra bearish.

I place my 130P SEP 2 puts, two nights before jackson hole, unfortunately AMZN went up 2.6% the next day. If this didn’t happen I should’ve been up $120k from the beginning.

Anyway, I kept buying and liquidating my put positions as the market ebbed and flowed down. I stopped today because I saw the inverse of what happened on the top of the market: very very low volume market buys we’re keeping the market up. The market should’ve been destroyed today, with the sell volume, but since the top side of the market is all wiped out, there are now huge gaps in ask sizes, causing it to moon upwards with ease. Another possible $100k+ day. I was up 35k and I waited out the action, until the aforementioned was too strong. Ended at 15k profit for the day.

Now ive deleted my trading app and I will time the housing market bottom and buy a nice 3 bedroom house for $600,000 CAD with a 20% down payment :) Which will be the equivalent to an $800,000 house right now, pre-upcoming-crash

1662046794,633,"In terms of Silicon Valley feuds, you’d be hard pressed to find one that’s spicier than the years-long battle between Meta and Apple. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg started steering his company toward virtual-reality tech, and now Apple CEO Tim Cook has made it clear he’s gunning for the same. Meta’s Facebook recently started testing out encrypted chats, a domain that Apple has dominated for years. 

Facebook is a company that historically hasn’t shied away from sharing user data with countless third parties. Meanwhile Apple AAPL, -0.67%, as its own glitzy ad campaigns constantly remind us, is the one tech company that doesn’t spray your data across the web. And, of course, there’s Apple’s recent privacy changes to its operating system that wiped out an estimated $10 billion of revenue for Meta META, -0.54%. At the same time, the advertisers that relied on the long-established tools on Facebook and Instagram were left without the data they long relied on for their businesses.

In the year since Apple CEO Tim Cook denounced ad-based business models as a source of real-world violence, Apple has ramped up plans to pop more ads into people’s iPhones and beef up the tech used to target those ads. And now it looks like Apple’s looking to poach the small businesses that have relied almost entirely on Facebook’s ad platform for more than a decade. MarketWatch found two recent job postings by Apple that suggest the company is looking to build out its burgeoning ad-tech team with folks who specialize in working with small businesses. Specifically, the company says it’s looking for two product managers who are “inspired to make a difference in how digital advertising will work in a privacy-centric world” and who want to “design and build consumer advertising experiences.” An ideal candidate, Apple said, won’t only be savvy in advertising and mobile tech, and advertising on mobile tech, but will also have experience with “performance marketing, local ads or enabling small businesses.” 

The listings also state that Apple’s looking for a manager who can “drive multi-year strategy and execution,” which suggests that Apple isn’t just tailing local advertisers but will likely be tailing those advertisers for a while. And considering how some of those small brands are already looking to jump ship from Facebook following Apple’s privacy changes, luring them off the platform might be enough to hamper Meta’s entire business structure for good, ad-tech analysts said. “If you talk to any small business, they’ll tell you, ‘Yeah, right now is a disaster,” said Eric Seufert, one analyst who’s been following the battle between Apple and Facebook evolve for  years. “It’s just a meltdown. There’s been a complete, devastating change to the environment.”

1662324285,15,"I know the reddit opinion of Meta isn't great, but I also think nobody understands it. It's not Crypto and NFT's, it's a bet on Virtual Reality. If you think Virtual Reality is going away, you're just simply wrong.  Everyone is bullish about Apple making $1000+ headsets for the first time, but suddently bearish when Meta makes BETTER headsets for less than half the cost?

Apple making VR Headsets is bullish FOR META because Meta owns all of the gaming infrastructure for the entire platform. You will be using Meta's platform, just on an Apple headset. Sure, Apple can turn it around, or attempt to turn it around, but they've already got the largest following, all of the infrastructure, and a years headstart in the VR/AR space.  Apple has a mobile games store.

I have not seen a single person use a VR headset and not be blown away by the technology. You put on the headset, and it's ready to use. You can use the hand controllers but it also can literally track your hands and you can play VR games just using their machine vision and hand tracking.

They have a BETTER VR headset than Apple for half the price and all of the infrastructure, and other's are trying to take a piece of the pie. They might be able to, but I think it either benefits them in the long term, or they fail trying to dethrone the Google of VR.  They have over 90% of the market share here, and have been perfecting VR/AR since 2014 when oculus was purchased, who has been working on the tech since 2012.

There isn't any similarities to the Crypto metaverse stuff. There's no NFTs, paid avatars, or wahtever. You have an avatar that follows you through games that you play as, but its completely free to use and customize and even if you do purchase things, for example, in game, thats not new. Most games have skins to purchase. It's just like Xbox avatars, Mii's, and everything else, except in VR. It's a bit more personal because you're playing as that charecter in games like poker, certain RPGs, etc and you look down and see it's your avatar, and its more immersive, but it's not like I am spending $4000 on a monkey picture and theres some open market that hyper monetizes VR.  In fact, there's DOZENS of free games and trials and experiences you can play within it. I didnt buy a game for the first several weeks because there's so much free stuff, including watching YouTube videos from the inside of the video and some other wild stuff.

It's unpopular, but:

1. 90% of the people, especially here, critical of Meta's vision of VR have never put on a VR headset
2. He might be an alien, but Zuck is spot on with his vision of VR.
3. Facebook, without their VR labs, is still an incredibly strong underlying business seeing lots of growth and printing money. Once VR takes off, that's only going to supplement the growth.

1662440037,513,"The Google-Facebook online ad duopoly may be breaking up. According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple’s ad business has benefited from the company’s major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple’s search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker’s App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google’s rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.

Apple has “joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,” according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple’s improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. “One of the things that’s quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn’t exist in the same way for Apple,” Lais said. “So you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.”

Apple’s rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon’s position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%. Amazon wasn’t listed because it’s not a platform for developers. At the lower end of the market, TikTok overtook Snap, which has also been hammered by ATT. TikTok has 3% market share, and Snap is at 2%, Appsumer said.

1662477500,5,"Apple Inc.’s coming iPhone 14 lineup might not bring too many new features, but there could be one big change in store. After holding steady on iPhone prices a year ago, some analysts expect that Apple AAPL, -0.10% will increase the price of its iPhone 14 Pro models this year amid camera, chip, and design enhancements—as well as lingering pressure from supply costs and the strong U.S. dollar. Amid the highest inflation rates in decades, there have been concerns about consumers growing more cost-conscious — especially lower-wage earners — but Apple is expected to keep its standard iPhone models at the same starting price while increasing the base $999 and $1,199 prices on its iPhone Pro and Pro Max.

“While the base iPhone will stay at the same price we believe a $100 price increase on the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max is likely in store given component price increases as well as added functionality on this new release,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a recent note to clients. The company is expected to debut the new iPhone family at a Wednesday event that will kick off at 1 p.m. Eastern time. Apple’s smartphones are its biggest business by far, bringing in more than $162 billion through three quarters of the company’s fiscal year, more than 57% of Apple’s revenue total.

But The planned iPhone 14 debut comes amid uncertainty about how smartphone demand will hold up in the macroeconomic climate. IDC recently projected a 6.5% decline in global smartphone shipments this year, after shipments underperformed their estimates while declining for four quarters in a row. iPhone demand seems to have held up better than the overall market, however, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on the company’s last earnings call that he hadn’t noticed “obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact” on the iPhone.

1662477913,6,"Electric vehicle maker, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is trading up in pre-market on Tuesday following a note by a Goldman Sachs analyst. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and $333.33 price target on TSLA after meeting with the company’s VP of Investor Relations, Martin Viecha.

Tesla believes that consumers will increasingly move toward EVs, even as it is too soon to quantify the effects of the newly signed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The analyst believes that consumers will be attracted to electric vehicles in the same way they were attracted towards other technology inflections (e.g. CRT to LCD TVs, and feature phones to smartphones). However, the EV industry could be supply-constrained over the intermediate term as new battery/component supply and assembly take time to ramp up.

Software and services, especially FSD, remain a key focus for the company as they continue to develop software and services to monetize the growing installed base of connected vehicles. Tesla believes FSD is one of the most important efforts in this category, and the company is targeting a wide release of its beta software in North America this year.

The analyst wrote in his note that he believes that ""Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs (including its vertical integration and tight coupling of hardware and software, as well as its ecosystem of charging stations and brand), and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses) is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6lyop/meta_has_been_fined_402_million_by_the_irish_data/)

A fat fine — of $402 million — is headed Instagram’s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children’s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Meta was contacted for comment on the penalty.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram’s parent, Friday — ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company’s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities — however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland’s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.”

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) — following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR’s transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform’s processing of children’s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally — as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn’t leak early).

While today’s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it’s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children’s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it’s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland’s draft decision — triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland’s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft — and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

However, that seems to be normalizing if not on the decline. Google's revenue growth itself went from high 50% yoy last year to about 10% yoy last quarter (although this is a bit skewed because of easy comps during covid adpocalypse, and now harder comps from the post covid ad boom).

1662539292,4,"I can’t help but see the big comparisons between the tech industry and the auto industry. I know I’m not the first person to say this, or even ask this question, but I find it interesting; but why do people treat the tech industry like it’s a gold rush? This new and shiny disrupter in the world of finance? 

Because, now don’t quote me because I’m not too learned in finance history, but isn’t the tech industry just like the auto industry 100 years ago? This new innovating idea that is seen as the big transformer to society? 

I’ve heard it said, but I couldn’t tell you who said it, but I think they said, “the tech industry will end up plateauing and become like the auto industry is today”. Now I’m no expert on finance or stock trading, but I think it has some good meaning there. Because when I look at the tech industry, I see it as this new trend that will probably end up shifting into obscurity once the next big trend hits, kinda like the auto industry did, it’ll still be there, but it’s so common place in society that it’s not really seen as the bringer of new innovation. 

I know quite a few people who work in the tech industry, and a few regular joes who have quite a bit of money in APPL and AMZN, and when I ask then if they think the tech industry will ever slow down or plateau they just laugh and say “it’s the future, it’ll always keep innovating and bringing new ideas”. Okay well, you could argue Ford did that, and look where they are now. 

Just wanted to get some of your opinions on it, because from my point of view, it seems a lot of people see the tech industry as this Big Daddy, and it gets people scared when the price of AMZN or APPL stock goes down.

So the Fed isn’t even really heartily fighting inflation yet. We don’t have a positive real fed funds rate. It’s hard to argue that we should turn wildly bullish anytime soon,” he added.

1662728032,12,"In  early 2020, I started my small portfolio for a simple ""fun"" strategy -   I pick stable big companies that pay dividends, but based on their  Dividend yield TTM.

Simply if the price of a company falls - then it's dividend yield rises. If the company can continue to pay it's dividends **(based on fundamental analysis)**  at an increasing rate, the price will adjust to it's median. Dividend  yield TTM is a ratio of share price to total payouts made over the last  12 months.

And this strategy  really surprised me - today my portfolio has 68% profit with 27% IRR and  2.8% yield on cost (1.7% dividend yield based on recent prices). And it  beats S&amp;P500 return by 20% for 2 years!

To be honest, AAPL makes 50% of its profits. I love this company and the  way they do business. I recorded a dividend yield of 1.4% for myself.

The next buy I think will be INTC, because only that bastard has negative returns in my portfolio and 10 year max div yield.

Even more than the word ""tapering"" or the words ""interest rate hike"". I have several friends of mine who have asked me since the June lows ""what do I do"" and my response is 100% of the time ""dollar cost average for as long as possible"". One person has $28k sitting in a checking account with no investments. I told them to withdraw $1k every month and pour it into VOO or SPY until they are down to $5k in checking. We can all disagree on if it would be better for them to just stick $23k of checking into VOO or SPY right now... 

My other friend is already heavily invested. He is like most people down about 18% YTD and tells me my advice of the past years ""dollar cost averaging"" is not cutting it for him. I feel bad he is down 18% YTD, but so is almost everyone else. 

Tell me why, if it is, that DCA is wrong. I think it is the best way to invest, and call me evil in bad times like this year, but it just is the best possible route. Both of my friends made me feel small today because they are certain we are going to have a 20% dip thanks to some of the talking heads out there saying things like the soon to come rate hike will lower stocks.

8% TSLA ($2,470)

Robinhood Markets is launching an index to track the favorite stocks of its millions of predominantly young, social-media-savvy customers. The brokerage firm’s new “Robinhood Investor Index” will track the performance of the 100 investments most popular among its user base. Initially, the top five stocks in the index will be Tesla , Apple, Amazon.com, Ford Motor and meme-stock favorite AMC Entertainment Holdings. Robinhood said it would update the composition of the index monthly, offering a view into its customers’ changing tastes. In an unusual approach to constructing an index, Robinhood said it would weight stocks in the index by the “conviction” customers have in them, defined as the percentage of assets in a customer's portfolio devoted to a particular stock. 

That means that if many Robinhood users devote a large part of their portfolio to one stock, it would rank higher in the index, even if those users' holdings were relatively small. Robinhood tends to have less-affluent customers, with smaller accounts, than other brokerages.

Robinhood has experimented with sharing such data before. During the early months of the pandemic, it released hourly data on the popularity of stocks among its customers, which were aggregated by the third-party website Robintrack.net. The site became a popular way to track retail-investor activity until Robinhood shut off the data feed in August 2020, citing concerns that its data could be “misconstrued or misunderstood.”","top 10 holdings tsla aapl amzn f amc msft nio dis ape gme source: robinhood markets launching index track favorite stocks millions predominantly young, social-media-savvy customers. brokerage firm’s new “robinhood investor index” track performance 100 investments popular among user base. initially, top five stocks index tesla , apple, amazon.com, ford motor meme-stock favorite amc entertainment holdings. robinhood said would update composition index monthly, offering view customers’ changing tastes. unusual approach constructing index, robinhood said would weight stocks index “conviction” customers them, defined percentage assets customer's portfolio devoted particular stock. means many robinhood users devote large part portfolio one stock, would rank higher index, even users' holdings relatively small. robinhood tends less-affluent customers, smaller accounts, brokerages. robinhood experimented sharing data before. early months pandemic, released hourly data popularity stocks among customers, aggregated third-party website robintrack.net. site became popular way track retail-investor activity robinhood shut data feed august 2020, citing concerns data could “misconstrued misunderstood.”","['Tesla', 'Robintrack.net', 'AMC Entertainment Holdings', 'Robinhood', 'Amazon', 'Walt Disney', 'Ford Motor', 'Apple', 'Robinhood Markets', 'Microsoft']"

**2% ASAN**

**\* Keeping 5% in cash at all times**

Yes, I know AAPL is already in some of the ETFs above. I want to own more of it that what is in my ETFs above. Tell me if I should add or take away anything? 

Edit: Right now I own almost nothing and my brokerage accounts are about 90% cash (own a few small cap stocks just to play with).

1663330099,1135,"Uber says it’s investigating a “cybersecurity incident” amidst reports that the company’s internal systems have been breached. The alleged hacker, who claims to be an 18-year old, says they have administrator access to company tools including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The New York Times reports that the ride-hailing business has taken multiple internal systems, including Slack, offline while it investigates the breach. The hacker appears to have made themselves known to Uber’s employees by posting a message on the company’s internal Slack system. “I announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach,” screenshots of the message circulating on Twitter read. The claimed hacker then listed confidential company information they said they’d accessed, and posted a hashtag saying that Uber underpays its drivers.

The Slack message from the alleged hacker was so brazen that many Uber employees appear to have initially thought it was a joke, the Washington Post reports. Employee responses to the post included lighthearted emoji like sirens and popcorn, as well as the “it’s happening” GIF. One unnamed Uber employee told Yuga Labs security engineer Sam Curry that staff were interacting with the hacker thinking they were playing a joke. “Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but I think IT would appreciate less memes while they handle the breach,” one employee’s response read, according to The Post.

The hacker claimed to the NYT to be 18 years old, and told The Post that they breached Uber for fun and is considering leaking the company’s source code. In a conversation with cybersecurity researcher Corben Leo, they also claimed to have gained access to Uber’s systems through login credentials obtained from an employee via social engineering, which allowed them to access an internal company VPN. From there, they found PowerShell scripts on Uber’s intranet containing access management credentials that allowed them to allegedly breach Uber’s AWS and G Suite accounts. “This is a total compromise, from what it looks like,” Curry told the NYT. “It seems like maybe they’re this kid who got into Uber and doesn’t know what to do with it, and is having the time of his life.”

1663358458,0,"Analyzing First Solar’s Short Interest.
09/16/2022 11:24am

First Solar's (NASDAQ:FSLR) short percent of float has fallen 6.53% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 4.36 million shares sold short, which is 4.72% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.7 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for First Solar has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.

Comparing First Solar's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro, First Solar's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.41%, which means the company has more short interest than most of its peers.

Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it..

*****
&gt; Stocks fell Friday as Wall Street wrapped up one of its worst weeks in months and traders reacted to an ugly earnings warning from FedEx about the global economy.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 139.40 points, or 0.45%, to close at 30,822.42. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.72% to end the week at 3,873.33. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.90% to finish at 11,448.40. It was the worst week for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq since June.
*****
&gt; Shares of FedEx plunged 21.4%, their worst daily drop ever, after the shipments company withdrew its full-year guidance and said it will implement cost-cutting initiatives to contend with soft global shipment volumes as the global economy “significantly worsened.”
*****
&gt; Transport stocks are typically seen as a leading indicator for the stock market as well as the economy, and FedEx pointed to weakness in Asia as one of the main reasons for its negative outlook. Shares of shipping rivals UPS and XPO Logistics dropped about 4.5% and 4.7%, respectively, and Amazon’s stock fell 2.1%.
*****
&gt; FedEx’s announcement comes soon after a hotter-than-expected inflation report in the U.S. on Tuesday, which raised concerns that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cause a recession to cool prices. That data sparked a decline of more than 1,200 points for the Dow.
*****
&gt; “There is a lot of nervousness about how the global economy can affect the U.S. economy now, while the U.S. economy is dealing with its own set of very serious issues. I think that dynamic is what people have woken up to,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro.
*****
&gt; The three major averages suffered their fourth losing week in five, and the summer comeback rally looks increasingly like a bear market bounce. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 4.1% this week. The S&amp;P 500 lost 4.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped about 5.5%.

&gt; # What a Way to Start the Weekend

&gt; If you've been in a particularly bad mood heading into weekends this year, you're obviously paying pretty close attention to the markets. With today's decline, the S&amp;P 500 is in the familiar position of ending the week with a decline of 1% or more. If the current declines hold up into the close, it will be the 12th daily drop of 1% or more to end a week this year. Going back to 1952 when the five trading day week started, there have only been five other years (1974, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2008) where there were as many or more down 1% Fridays (or last trading day of the week) in a given year. As you might expect, all five of those years were lousy for the stock market.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091622-Number-Down-1-Weeks2.png))**

&gt; While this year is currently tied for having the fourth-highest number of 1%+ down days, the year isn't even three-quarters done (heaven help us). After today there are still another 15 weeks left in the year, so there is plenty of time to move up the rankings. On a percentage basis, the S&amp;P 500 has closed down at least 1% on the last trading day of the week just under a third (32.4%) of the time, and if that pace were to keep up for the remainder of the year, 2022 would easily set the record for the highest frequency of 1% declines to close out the week. Never have we needed a happy hour more than this year.

&gt; On page 108 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (see pinned tweet) we discuss the Aura of the Triple Witch, when stock options, stock index options and stock index futures all expire at the same time four times each year. It’s important as it usually increases volume and volatility.

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –0.98%, S&amp;P 500 –0.89%, NASDAQ –0.85% and Russell 2000 –1.44%. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter. And next week we have the Fed rate hike decision to contend with.

&gt; # Bad CPI, ugly trading, but history of 4% daily declines shows good gains…eventually

&gt; Today’s hotter than anticipated CPI report was the bad that triggered the day’s ugly across-the-board declines. Surging Treasury bond yields hit NASDAQ the hardest, off 5.16% today. Tech-heavy S&amp;P 500 was down 4.32% while DJIA was off 3.94%. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has declined 4% or more in a single day 53 times before today. In those previous 53 occurrences, on the next trading day S&amp;P 500 was higher 35 times and lower 18 with an average gain of 1.08% on all days. Based upon historical performance, the odds of a gain tomorrow are 66.04%.

&gt; However, the line chart of the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 53 greater than 4% drops does not suggest any significant advance in the near-term as S&amp;P 500 only managed a modest recover, on average over the next 20-25 trading days (a typical month is generally 21 trading days). But the following table does showcase solid gains in the majority of occurrences when looking forward the next 3-, 6- and 12-months. S&amp;P 500 was higher 82.7% of the time one year after a greater than 4% daily decline with an average gain over 25%.

&gt; # 11%+ Annualized - Not Bad for the 'Worst Trade Ever'

&gt; It has now been 14 years since Lehman Brothers' last day as a solvent company - an event that set off one of the biggest market meltdowns of all time. In hindsight, the events leading up to and after September 2008 may not seem all that bad. How quickly we forget. Three-quarters of a century removed from the Great Depression, most Americans had never given a second thought to the safety of the funds in their savings account or even money-market funds, but shortly after Lehman, these were legitimate concerns on the part of all Americans. People were actually going to ATMs and taking out extra cash to literally put 'under their mattress' just in case they woke up and the ATMs weren't working anymore.

&gt; Most of these extremes came after the Lehman bankruptcy, but the period leading up to Lehman wasn't a picnic either; that's actually why Lehman went belly-up. From the S&amp;P 500's peak in October 2007 through 9/12/08, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 20%. But after an early summer sell-off, the S&amp;P 500 rallied from mid-July to mid-August before selling off into Labor Day. Heading into the weekend after Labor Day, the S&amp;P 500 was down 4% from its mid-August high but appeared to be stabilizing at a higher low relative to July. With the S&amp;P 500 still down 20% from its all-time high, you couldn't have faulted someone heading into the weekend for thinking ""maybe I'll try to buy something on sale.""

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091222-100907.png))**

&gt; On 9/12/08, stocks may have been on sale relative to the October 2007 highs, but any buys on that day would quickly go down as one of the 'worst trades ever.' After Lehman announced its bankruptcy that weekend, cracks spread all over the financial district from a Wall Street parched of liquidity. September ended with a decline of nearly 10% but continued to get worse from there, and by the following March, the S&amp;P 500 was down just under 46% - or 71% annualized - from its 'pre-Lehman' close'. Stocks that seemed cheap less than six months earlier were now down by nearly half, so getting back to even from there would pretty much require a double. Speaking from experience, any investor who bought any stocks in those six months quickly felt like the stupidest investor in the world.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091222-091208-030909.png))**

&gt; While any equity purchases made 14 years ago just before Lehman collapsed quickly turned into some of the worst trades ever, time is an investor's best friend. Anyone who had time gradually looked less foolish. From a longer-term perspective, the decline from September 2008 to March 2009 still looks painful, but over time, the market (as it has to this point always done) dug itself out of its hole. The snowball effect of compounding has rewarded investors who were in it for the long haul. Not including dividends, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 227% since the Friday before Lehman's bankruptcy, and including dividends, it has delivered an annualized return of more than 11%. You'd probably sign the bottom line as fast as you could for an annualized return of 11% between now and 2036!

&gt; Not bad for what seemed like the ""worst trade ever"" at the time.

It has been a ton of fun meeting with our advisors, learning more about our industry, presenting our investment views, but best of all making new friends. If you want to come to the very best conference for advisors, please be sure to make it next year in Nashville.

&gt; Here’s a quick blog I put together (take note I’m running on fumes out here) that looks at seasonality and why late September and into October is one period that investors need to be aware can be bumpy.

&gt; Here’s a similar chart, but it looks at midterm years. Yes, right about now isn’t historically a bullish timeframe, but check out what tends to happen once you get later in the year and past the uncertainty of the midterm election. We are optimistic that history could repeat itself once again.

&gt; Zooming in some and it becomes even more clear that late September can be a slide down.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3-3-800x369.png))**

&gt; Another look at this is a popular chart we’ve shared before, but it really does a nice job of showing just how weak some of the upcoming days are for the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/4-2-800x475.png))**

&gt; So buckle up, as the calendar isn’t doing to any near-term favors, but we remain overweight equities and think the low for the year is in and once we can get past this seasonally weak period, a nice end of year rally is quite possible.

&gt; # Sentiment Contradicts Price Action

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 may have fallen around 1.5% over the past week, but individual investors have reportedly become increasingly bullish. 26.1% of responses to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish this week, up from a recent low of 18.1% last week. With the S&amp;P 500's worst day in since June 2020 and a hotter-than-expected CPI print occurring late in the response collection period (12:01 AM on Thursday through 11:59 PM Wednesday night), the timing of responses is a potential cause for the increase in optimism that was contrary to equities' price action. In other words, responses that came in prior to Tuesday were likely far more bullish than those that came in afterward and therefore elevating the level of bullish sentiment. As such, next week will be a more telling read on individual investor sentiment as it will more fully capture recent price action and inflation data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091522-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; While bulls rose back above a quarter of responses, bears fell back below 50%. Bearish sentiment dropped to 46% which was only the lowest level since the week of August 24th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091522-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Those moves meant the bull-bear spread rose 15.3 points week over week going from -35.2 up to -19.9. That was the largest one-week jump in the reading since the end of June. However, that indicates sentiment remains heavily in favor of pessimism as the streak of negative readings grows to 24 weeks long; the second longest streak of negative readings on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091522-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showing a rebound in sentiment. Both the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index highlighted increased bullishness in the latest week's data. As with the AAII survey, though, the collection periods likely did not fully capture the effects of Tuesday's inflation data and historic one-day decline. Overall, the story remains that investors are remarkably bearish.

&gt; # 4% Daily Drop with VIX Under 30 Unheard Of

&gt; Today’s bounce back was in line with the stats we posted yesterday, but the gains and trading were uninspired. What stuck out was the 4% drop came with VIX below 30 all day. Never happened before.

&gt; Since 1990 when VIX data began S&amp;P 500 had 42 daily declines of 4% or more. Only 8 had a VIX print below 30 and zero that did not have a print above 30. 7 of the 8 opened below 30 and one hit a low below 30 intraday. VIX was below 30 all day 9/13/2022.

&gt; October 27, 1997 Asian contagion mini crash, February 5, 2018 inflation fear selloff and June 11, 2020 Covid second wave scare were one-offs. The rest were just the beginning of trouble. Triple Witching, end Q3, Fed decision, September’s bearish history, Octoberphobia, midterms could make the comps between now and then a little fuzzy. But September 15, 2008, was also Monday of Triple Witching Week – and that brings in the scary 2008 analog into play, but that’s for another day.

&gt; # Pain in CPI

&gt; With investors expecting consumer prices to fall month-over-month heading into the day, this morning's higher-than-expected headline and core CPI reports caused an instantaneous reversal in market sentiment heading into the opening bell. While equity index futures were indicating a gain of around 75 basis points heading into the print, after the release, indications were for a decline of 2%. When the opening bell finally rang, the S&amp;P 500 gapped down 2.27% as indicated by the tracking ETF - SPY.

&gt; Going back to 1998, today marked just the sixth time that SPY gapped down in excess of 2% on the day of a CPI release. As shown in the top of the table below, on four of the five prior 2%+ gaps down on CPI days, SPY not only gapped down by over 2%, but it continued lower throughout the trading day. While that doesn't necessarily bode well for today, we would note that on many of those prior occurrences, there were other overriding factors impacting the market. From the Russian debt default and collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998 to the Financial Crisis in 2008, the US debt downgrade in 2011, and then COVID in 2020, on most of these other days, investors had other issues besides inflation to worry about. The only time that there wasn't another major issue impacting the market was on 5/14/99 when headline CPI exceeded forecasts by 0.3 ppts and core CPI exceeded consensus estimates by 0.2 ppts.

&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have listed every other time since 1998 that core CPI exceeded consensus forecasts by 0.3 ppts or more. Today's report is just the fourth time that core CPI has topped estimates by such a wide margin, but what stands out most is that every other prior occurrence since 1998 came after COVID. We noted numerous times in the past how COVID has created so many distortions in the economy that the job of forecasting it has become exceedingly difficult, and the fact that every 'beat' of this magnitude in core CPI has occurred since COVID only reinforces this point.

1663530136,387,"[Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220918181734/https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack)  


For the past decade there were two more or less universally acknowledged truths about digital advertising. First, the rapidly growing industry was largely impervious to the business cycle. Second, it was dominated by the duopoly of Google (in search ads) and Meta (in social media), which one jealous rival has compared to John Rockefeller’s hold on oil in the 19th century.

Both of these verities are now being challenged simultaneously. As China’s economy slows and the West’s slides towards a recession, companies everywhere are squeezing their marketing budgets. Until recently, that would have meant cutting non-digital ads but maintaining, or even raising, online spending. With most ad dollars now going online, that strategy is running out of road. Last quarter Meta reported its first-ever year-on-year decline in revenues. Snap, a smaller rival, is laying off a fifth of its workforce.

For Meta and Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet, the cyclical problem may not be the worst of it. They might once have hoped to offset the digital-ad pie’s slower growth by grabbing a larger slice of it. No longer. Although the two are together expected to rake in around $300bn in revenues this year, sales of their four biggest rivals in the West will amount to almost a quarter as much. If that does not sound like a lot, it is nevertheless giving the incumbents reason to worry. Five years ago most of those rivals were scarcely in the ad business at all (see chart). What is more, as digital advertising enters a period of transformation, the challengers look well-placed to increase their gains.

The noisiest newcomer to the digital-ad scene is TikTok. In the five years since its launch the short-video app has sucked ad dollars away from Facebook and Instagram, Meta’s two biggest properties. So much so that the two social networks are reinventing themselves in the image of their Chinese-owned rival. TikTok’s worldwide revenue will exceed $11bn this year and will be double that by 2024, forecasts eMarketer, a firm of analysts.

The TikTok threat is well known—not least to Meta’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, who mentioned the “unique” competitor five times on a recent earnings call. But Meta and Google may have more to worry about closer to home, where a trio of American tech firms are loading ever more ads around their main businesses.

Chief among them is Amazon, forecast to take nearly 7% of worldwide digital-ad revenue this year, up from less than 1% just six years ago. The company started reporting details of its ad business only in February, when it revealed sales in 2021 of $31bn. As Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, points out, that is roughly as much as the ad sales of the entire global newspaper industry. Amazon executives now talk of advertising as one of the company’s three “engines”, alongside retail and cloud computing.

Next in line is Microsoft, expected to quietly take more than 2% of global sales this year—slightly more than TikTok. Its search engine, Bing, has only a small share of the search market, but that market is a gigantic one. Microsoft’s social network, LinkedIn, is unglamorous but its business-to-business ads allow it to monetise the time users spend on it at a rate roughly four times that of Facebook, estimates Andrew Lipsman of eMarketer. It generates more revenue than some medium-sized networks including Snap’s Snapchat and Twitter.

The most surprising new adman is Apple. The iPhone-maker used to rail against intrusive digital advertising. Now it sells many ads of its own. As sales of smartphones plateau, the company is looking for new ways to monetise the 1.8bn devices, from smartphones to smart earphones, it already has in circulation. So far it is only dabbling in ads and does not report sales figures. But Bloomberg reported recently that Apple’s ad business was already generating sales of $4bn a year, making it about as big an ad platform as Twitter. Apple executives believe there is much more to be had.

They may well be right. Changes are coming to the digital-advertising industry which will suit the big-tech challengers. Apple itself is in part responsible for what may be the most consequential development. Its rules on “app-tracking transparency” (att), introduced last year, have made it much harder for advertisers to follow users around the web to serve them ads based on their interests. The eu’s Digital Services Act, unveiled earlier this year, takes steps in the same direction. America is mulling similar legislation of its own.

The crackdown on tracking has been especially hard on platforms that serve display ads, which target consumers on the basis of their interests, as opposed to things they have actively searched for. Meta, whose social networks specialise in such ads, said in February that att would knock $10bn off its ad business this year. It is trying to develop other ways of divining consumers’ interests. So are smaller platforms reliant on display ads, but their task is more difficult without Meta’s deep pockets. Or at least that is how investors see it: Snap’s market value has plummeted by 83%, or $97bn, in the past 12 months.

Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, by contrast, are insulated against anti-tracking initiatives. They rely mostly on “first party” data of their own. Amazon’s ads are based on what users search for on its site: type “socks” into its search bar and you will see sponsored promotions for exactly that. Microsoft’s Bing is similarly immune. LinkedIn is probably less so, though Microsoft could theoretically use data from Bing to fine-tune the ads shown to LinkedIn users (at the moment it does not, though it has looked into it). Ads on Apple’s app store follow the same principle as Amazon: search for TikTok, say, and you may see an ad for a rival app like Pinterest. Apple is rumoured to be preparing to introduce ads on its Maps app, to promote local businesses. Through its move into payments it could learn about customers’ shopping habits. None of this would require tracking, since the behaviour all happens on Apple’s platform.

Advertising’s other big coming change is the migration of television-viewing from broadcast and cable to internet-connected tvs, capable of delivering targeted ads. Amazon has already shown ads alongside sport on its Prime Video streaming service. Apple has done the same on Apple tv+, and may yet launch an ad-supported subscription tier, as rivals Netflix and Disney+ soon will. Microsoft has no tv offering, but its acquisition earlier this year of Xandr, an ad-tech company, has given it a foothold in serving ads for other streamers. In July Netflix chose Microsoft to run its forthcoming ad business—to disappointment at Google, which had bid for the contract, and to some surprise at Microsoft itself.

Digital advertising is spreading into other markets where the new challengers are well positioned. Audio is undergoing a similar digitisation to video, as listening switches to streamed music and podcasting. This presents an opportunity for Amazon and Apple, both of which have audio-streaming services and make smart speakers. Both also have voice-activated assistants, Alexa and Siri, who could just as easily bark out promotions as take orders. Amazon sees Alexa as a future saleswoman as well as a servant.

Meanwhile, Microsoft’s pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a video-gaming giant, will make it a powerful force in that fast-growing and increasingly ad-supported industry. Its Xbox console already shows some ads on the user’s on-screen “dashboard” and will reportedly soon offer more help for developers to sell in-game ads. Activision’s units include King, the maker of “Candy Crush”; last year King generated revenue of $2.6bn from ads and in-game purchases by its quarter of a billion players.

As digital ads work their way into more corners of the economy, “a new order is going to materialise”, believes Mr Lipsman. He thinks Amazon will overtake Meta in total advertising revenue, possibly within five years. Google is better placed to take advantage of the coming changes, with its healthy search ads and its vast YouTube video and audio services. Still, it will find things more competitive in future. The incumbent digital-ad duo might have hoped that, as ever more advertising went online, their empires would only extend. It looks instead as if new rivals will reach into their business.","( past decade two less universally acknowledged truths digital advertising. first, rapidly growing industry largely impervious

Today was an ugly day… however moving foreword what do we have in the TSLA horizon? Well… September 30 we get Tesla Ai day so we might see a potential recovery leading up to that day. Also, October is around the corner and we’ll get to see Teslas delivery numbers. The expected wait times has shortened which could indicate a bear case and a bull case… the Bear case is that there is a crazy amount of cancellations which have been the result of closing showrooms in China. The bull case is that production in the giga factories have been getting better and they are delivering cars at a much more comfortable pace. Then earnings, expected 10/18-10/24 (not official). Not sure if the currency changes will be such a big factor to the downside…. But perhaps deliveries will aid that. 

All in all, I’m bullish Tesla. It’s a mega cap that has been performed relatively well. I think that this “low price per share” will also make investors perceive a “lower price” for a company effectively going full steam.

This is just my opinion and I’m a random dude on the internet….

I do a quarterly deep-dive on my stocks, keep up on all relevant daily news, and spend 1-2 hours at night reading relevant publications (Barron's, Kiplinger, Seeking Alpha, Various Fund Letters), so I feel pretty confident in my ability to keep up on the stocks. But I love getting outside feedback.   


In descending account % order, here is my portfolio - do you all see any glaring weak stocks that I may be overlooking or things that are weighted oddly?

1663930386,33,"So the Porsche IPO will likely happen by the end of the month despite the pessimistic state the global markets seems to be currently in \[1\].
&amp;#x200B;

VW is targeting around 75 billion euros, they will also keep 75% of the shares and are planning to pay out 49% of the proceeds as a special dividend to current shareholders by the end of the year (if my calculations are correct that should be around  €15 per share).

However currently VOW3 is trading at \~145 which besides a slump to the 120s in early July is around the price they have been at since March (and the status and timing of the IPO wasn't that clear during most of this period). At current prices the 75% share of Porsche VW will retain should be worth around 51 billion meaning that the rest of VW would only be valued at approximately 28 billion?

Now VW has massive amounts of debt, Porsche is it's most profitable subsidiary, VOW3 has outperformed DAX since July and Porsche share price might collapse after the IPO but does that really seem like a fair valuation for VW?

Even without Porsche it would still maintain fairly decent fundamentals compared to it's competitors. VW seems to be ahead of most other legacy car makers in EV, according to units shipped it should be second after Tesla this year and based on some some estimates [2] it might even ship more cars than Tesla by 2024/25 (even if that won't happen they are still showing pretty decent YoY growth). If the special dividend is mostly priced in that would bring down VOW3 to €128 which around what it would be trading at if it followed the DAX PERFORMANCE-INDEX after July (but it would still be considerably underperforming it YTD, currently they are both around 20% down YTD).

Also Porsche itself seems to be in a great position to challenge Tesla higher end models (especially in markets outside of NA) as long as VW is successful at scaling up it's EV production: The Taycan is priced competitively compared to Model S and and their upcoming EV SUV should be able to compete with Model X as well.

Buying Porsche at the IPO price is probably not best idea as a retail investor, but what about VOW3(VWAPY in the US)?  Or is VW actually worth less than Stellantis, GM, Ford or even BMW when Porsche is subtracted from it?

# **Dow drops nearly 500 points to close at new low for 2022 on rising recession fears - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/futures-inch-higher-following-another-day-of-losses-after-fed-rate-hike-sell-offs.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday to cap a brutal week for financial markets, as surging interest rates and foreign currency turmoil heightened fears of a global recession.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 486.27 points, or 1.62%, to 29,590.41. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.72% to 3,693.23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8% to 10,867.93.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched a new low for the year and closed below 30,000 for the first time since June 17. The 30-stock index ended the day 19.9% below an intraday record, flirting with bear market territory. At one point, the Dow was down more than 826 points.
*****
&gt; The major averages capped their fifth negative week in six, with the Dow giving up 4%. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq shed 4.65% and 5.07%, respectively. It marked the fourth negative session in a row for stocks, as the Fed on Wednesday enacted another super-sized rate hike of 75 basis points and indicated it would do another at its November meeting.
*****
&gt; “The market has been transitioning clearly and quickly from worries over inflation to concerns over the aggressive Federal Reserve campaign,” said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial. “You see bond yields rising to levels we haven’t seen in years — it’s changing the mindset to how does the Fed get to price stability without something breaking.”
*****
&gt; The British pound hit a fresh more than three-decade low against the U.S. dollar after a new U.K. economic plan that included a slew of tax cuts rattled markets that are fearing inflation above all right now. Major European markets lost 2% on the day.
*****
&gt; “This is a global macro mess that the market is trying to sort out,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Bond yields soared this week following the Fed’s actions, with the 2-year and 10-year Treasury rates hitting highs not seen in over a decade.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its year-end S&amp;P 500 target because of rising rates, predicting at least a 4% downside from here.
*****
&gt; Stocks positioned to suffer the most in a recession led the week’s losses with the S&amp;P 500′s consumer discretionary sector falling 7%. Energy slumped 9% as oil prices dropped. Growth stocks, including big technology names Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms fell on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Based on our client discussions, a majority of equity investors have adopted the view that a hard landing scenario is inevitable and their focus is on the timing, magnitude, and duration of a potential recession and investment strategies for that outlook,” wrote Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin in a note to clients as he cut his outlook.

&gt; So, it might be a bit late for Sell Rosh Hashanah, but Buy Yom Kippur is looking like a good set up. A host of fears from inflation, hawkish Fed, bellicose Russia, global upheaval, US midterm politics is exacerbating the usual seasonal and 4-year cycle carnage.

&gt; The thesis is that folks sell positions on Rosh Hashanah the first of the Days of Awe to rid themselves of financial commitments and then return to the market after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It is no coincidence that this coincides with the seasonal September/October weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/73ee07aab9aad9010423b62e060f0ce7/8489dff9c57e81f8-a9/s500x750/8283b997870471cc877e46b4686b6b8734cd2e12.jpg))**

&gt; Interestingly the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period is not so bad in midterm years, likely due to the fact it lands at the end of the Weak Spot and the beginning of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year cycle – the best buying opportunity of the 4-Year Cycle.

&gt; # Five Reasons Inflation Isn’t So Sticky

&gt; After the disappointing all around Consumer Price Index (CPI) report last week, the worries over inflation staying higher for longer (what they call sticky) is a very real worry. That report showed prices for many goods and services were increasing more than expected (even things like dental services were much higher than expected), while nearly every economist we saw on tv before the report was saying inflation had peaked and would be heading down, and in a hurry.

&gt; Full disclosure, I was in that camp as well, as I discussed with Yahoo! Finance here.

&gt; Well, it isn’t all bad news, as there are many signs inflation could still come back down quickly. For one thing gas prices continue to head lower, as my colleague Sonu Varghese recently wrote about. Sure, core consumer prices (excluding energy and food) are higher than anyone would like, but there are other types of inflation than just at the consumer level.

&gt; Here are five reasons that suggest inflation could still fall quite quickly and last month’s CPI data isn’t the beginning of a new trend.

&gt; First up, used car prices collapsed four percent last month according to the Manheim Used Car Value Index. This was the second largest monthly decline ever and the year-over-year change is down to 8.4%, the lowest since June 2020. This large drop wasn’t accounted for in the recent CPI report and will put downward pressure on prices over the coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-092122.png))**

&gt; Second, how much companies are paying for things is going down and quickly. Looking at the prices paid component of the ISM services and manufacturing surveys show a big move lower the past few months. Prices paid tends to lead overall CPI by several months, and so this is another reason to think inflation could come down quickly before year-end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-092122.png))**

&gt; Third, the ISM is a national survey, but regional surveys show similar results. The recent Philly Fed and Empire State surveys each show prices paid crashing lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-092122.png))**

&gt; Fourth, supply chain issues were a major reason for the huge spike in inflation. So, you would think once those supply chains begin to improve, so would inflation. The good news is we are seeing substantial improvements in supply chains. For instance, back in January more than 100 ships were caught in a logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, yet earlier this month there were less than 10 ships. And as the chart below shows, overall supply chain pressures have come down significantly. Another source of potential downward pressure on overall inflation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-092122.png))**

&gt; Lastly, prices at the producer level have come back much quicker than at the consumer level. The Producer Price Index (PPI) year-over-year peaked at 11.6% in March, but it was already down to 8.7% five months later. Compare that with the CPI peaking at just over 9.0% and only at 8.3% currently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-092122.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Inflation is still a major issue, and that recent CPI report wasn’t pretty in any way. But there is light at the end of the inflation tunnel, as other aspects of inflation is showing some incredible improvement and not many people are noticing.

***** 

&gt; # September to (Not) Remember

&gt; Hat tip George Noble @gnoble79 for this title from his superb Twitter Space today. He has been on point all year. Disappointing CPI and increasingly hawkish remarks and action from the Fed clearly brought the usual September peak early. But that does not mean we are out of the woods.

&gt; Late September is still a dangerous period for the market, especially month-end, and then there is Octoberphobia to contend with, which promises to be turbulent with all the market must digest. On top of the Fed, inflation, weaker fundamentals, fickle market internals, shaky technicals we have the negative seasonality from fund tax selling, end of Q3 window dressing and portfolio restructuring.

&gt; We have been cautious all year and mostly in cash, having honored our stops and indicators. June lows are only 1% away for the Dow, S&amp;P 3.4%, NASDAQ 5.4%, Russell 2000 6.8%. Cash is still king. Patience is in order. We are sticking to our Seasonal Trading Playbook. If you’re not nimble and able to trade quickly, wait for our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

&gt; # Worse Before It Gets Better

&gt; For those checking in on our Seasonality Tool in the past week, the current point of the year can either look like one of the worst, middling, or best times of the year depending on the time frame. As shown below, the median one-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the close on 9/20 over the last ten years has been a decline of 95 bps loss which ranks in just the fourth percentile of all days of the year. Extending out to look at the S&amp;P 500's median one-month performance, the 105 bps median gain is about smack dab in the middle of the range of historical one-month returns. Moving out to three months, the S&amp;P 500's median gain of 578 bps ranks in the top 5% of all days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-1.png))**

&gt; To look at seasonality in another way, the charts below show the average S&amp;P 500 5-day performance (including a smoothed look via a 7-day moving average) and the percentage of time the index has traded positively at each calendar day of the year going all the way back to 1945. The current week of the year has averaged some of the worst one-week returns for the S&amp;P 500 across all years of the post-WWII period while the index has tended to fall more often than not.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-5-Day.png))**

&gt; Again, contrary to short-term seasonal weakness, taking a similar look but using a 3-month performance window, we are entering one of the best times of the year. As shown below, the second half of September into October sees the average 3-month performance rocket higher and by early October has tended to be the strongest of any point of the year.

&gt; # The Biggest Pandemic Losers

&gt; With President Biden declaring that ""the pandemic is over"" on 60 Minutes last night, we thought we'd take a look at stock market performance since the pandemic began. At its peak on January 3rd, 2022, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 40% from its closing price on February 19th, 2020 -- the peak reading for the index prior to the COVID Crash. After entering bear market territory in 2022, the S&amp;P is currently only 14% above its pre-COVID high. In the Russell 1,000 -- another large-cap index -- 41% of stocks are now trading below their closing price on February 19th, 2020. 20% of stocks in the index are down more than 20%! Given that two and a half years have passed, we think it's safe to say that any stock down 20% from pre-COVID levels has been a ""pandemic loser."" At least at this point in time.

&gt; Below are stocks with market caps above $15 billion that are down at least 20% from their closing price on 2/19/20. Names like Boeing (BA), Delta (DAL), Uber (UBER), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) were some of the initial ""lockdown losers"" that never really recovered, but other stocks that were initially viewed as ""lockdown winners"" are also on the list like Netflix (NFLX), Meta (META), Spotify (SPOT), and Zoom Video (ZM). Go figure.

&gt; Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC) have been two of the biggest losers since pre-COVID with declines of more than 56%. Other ""blue chips"" that have been crushed since the pandemic hit include Biogen (BIIB), Citigroup (C), General Electric (GE), Verizon (VZ), 3M (MMM), Square (SQ), Disney (DIS), Adobe (ADBE), and salesforce (CRM). It's interesting that there's representation from nearly every sector of the economy on this list. The only sector that's NOT included is Energy, which is crazy since the sector was one of the hardest hit in the early days of COVID as the price of oil even went negative for a day.

&gt; Of course, COVID isn't the reason why all of these large-cap stocks are now down so much since the pandemic began, but the performance numbers are the performance numbers, and there's no getting around it. Management at big travel &amp; leisure companies have always wished COVID never happened, but more and more companies in sectors like Tech that thought the pandemic might be a game-changer for them in a positive way are now staring at big 2+ year declines thinking ""what the hell just happened.""

1664116047,757,"Share prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&amp;P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&amp;P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.”***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

&gt;&gt;Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&amp;P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

# [Stock futures rise as S&amp;P 500 and Dow try to bounce back from lowest levels since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/stock-futures-are-little-changed-after-sp-500-closes-at-lowest-level-since-2020.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 tried to bounce back from their lowest closing levels in nearly two years.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
&gt; Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&amp;P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
&gt; The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
&gt; “Typically, US investors wouldn’t care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,” said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed’s six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

I'm tempted to buy more to bring down my avg price  but it keeps dipping !

Today seemingly there was some good news that Ford is investing 700 mill in a Kentucky truck plant, creating jobs, and somehow the stock dipped 2% ? 

It seems like it's just been moving in lockstep with SPY. 

Someone has told me Ford is in a mountain of debt because of their transition to electric, but cant read a balance sheet. 

I figured they pay a good dividend and with the high demand of the f150 lightning, they're well positioned to compete with Tesla for US market, and their valuation is down to earth.

# [Stock futures fall after S&amp;P 500 hits new low for the year; 10-year Treasury yield briefly tops 4%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/27/stock-market-news-open-to-close-futures-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Wednesday as traders struggle to find their footing after the S&amp;P 500 notched a fresh bear market low in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 57 points, or about 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid about 0.9%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Apple were down nearly 4% in premarket trading after a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, said the tech company is ditching plans to increase new iPhone production after demand fell short of expectations.
*****
&gt; Stock futures pared earlier losses after the Bank of England said it would temporarily purchase long-dated UK government bonds in an effort to stabilize the plunging British pound. Sterling briefly popped on the news before trading 0.5% lower against the dollar at $1.0647.
*****
&gt; The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield gave back its initial gains after the announcement, last trading at about 3.93%. Earlier in the trading session, the benchmark rate broke above 4% for the first time since 2008.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session in which the S&amp;P 500 reached a new bear market low of 3,623.29 and posted its sixth straight day of losses, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a gain.
*****
&gt; Several technical metrics show that the stock market may be oversold, but some on Wall Street are worried that investors have not priced in an earnings slowdown and the impact of the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes. The S&amp;P 500 breaking below its previous low is a key indicator for some that stocks still have further to fall.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re certainly not at the end of the road in terms of pricing in the full recessionary outcome. … We really need to get to dirt cheap valuations on equities, and we’re not quite there yet,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, said on Tuesday’s “Closing Bell.”

7:25 am ET September 28, 2022

**Eli Lilly And Co** (NYSE: LLY) shares are trading higher by 7.60% to $334.75 during Wednesday's pre-market session after **Biogen Inc** (NASDAQ: BIIB) and **Eisai Co. Ltd.** announced late Tuesday positive results from a late-stage study of their Alzheimer’s treatment candidate.

Eli Lilly's donanemab, an investigational antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease, is in trial to treat early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

**What Happened?**

Biogen and Eisai announced Lecanemab treatment met the primary endpoint and reduced clinical decline on the global cognitive and functional scale, CDR-SB, compared with placebo at 18 months by 27%, which represents a treatment difference in the score change of -0.45 (p=0.00005) in the analysis of Intent-to-treat (ITT) population.

The companies said starting as early as six months, across all time points, the treatment showed highly statistically significant changes in CDR-SB from baseline compared to placebo (all p-values are less than 0.01).

In addition, all key secondary endpoints were also met with highly statistically significant results compared with placebo (p&lt;0.01).

""Today's announcement gives patients and their families hope that lecanemab, if approved, can potentially slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and provide a clinically meaningful impact on cognition and function,"" said **Michel Vounatsos**, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen.

# [Stock futures fall after Wednesday’s big market rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/stock-market-news-open-to-close-futures-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slumped Thursday, putting the major averages on track to give back some of the sharp gains seen in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones dropped 181 points, or 0.7%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves followed a broad rally for stocks a day earlier, as the Bank of England said it would purchase bonds in an effort to help steady its financial markets and the cratering British pound. Sterling has stooped to record lows against the U.S. dollar in recent days.
*****
&gt; It marked a stark shift from the aggressive tightening campaign many global central banks have undertaken to cope with surging inflation.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Wednesday gained or 1.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 2% after hitting a new bear market low on Tuesday. Both indexes snapped six-day losing streaks.
*****
&gt; As stocks rose and the BOE shared its bond-buying plan, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped the most since 2020 after briefly topping 4%.
*****
&gt; “We are skeptical that the calmer mood in markets on Wednesday marks an end to the recent period of elevated volatility or risk-off sentiment. For a more sustained rally, investors will need to see convincing evidence that inflation is coming under control, allowing central banks to become less hawkish,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Thursday note.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s rally put the major averages on pace to eke out small gains for the week, but they are still on track to cap off their worst month since June. The Nasdaq Composite is leading the monthly losses, down about 6.5%, while the Dow and S&amp;P are on pace to close 5.8% and 5.9% lower, respectively.
*****
&gt; On a quarterly basis, the Nasdaq is on track to break a two-quarter losing streak, while the Dow is headed for its third consecutive quarterly loss for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. The S&amp;P is on pace for its third negative quarter in a row for the first time since its six-quarter negative streak that ended the first quarter of 2009.

Today the view looks much different. Meta has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in September 2021. The stock is trading at its [lowest](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/16/meta-shares-plunged-14percent-this-week-falling-close-to-their-pandemic-low.html) since January 2019 and is about to close out its third straight quarter of double-digit percentage losses. Only four stocks in the [S&amp;P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance) are having a worse year.

Facebook’s business was built on network effects — users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies. Suddenly everyone was convening in one place. Advertisers followed, and the company’s ensuing profits — and they were plentiful — provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.

But in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook’s once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company’s future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.

Zuckerberg [said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse “will reach a billion people” and “host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.” He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html) CNBC’s Jim Cramer in June that the “North Star” is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a “massive economy” around digital goods.

Investors aren’t enthusiastic about it, and the way they’re dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can’t recover.

“I’m not sure there’s a core business that works anymore at Facebook,” said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.

Nobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.

The Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it’s no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that’s the only thing it’s known. The company’s slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.

The number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.

“I don’t see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I’m just worried that they’re not winning the next generation,” said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.

Sales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.

Meta has been trying to mimic TikTok’s success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users’ Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely “get tremendous revenue flow from that” algorithmic shift.

However, Facebook acknowledges it’s early days for monetizing Reels, and it’s not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok’s business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China’s ByteDance.

[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who’s [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.

“I think it’s very promising,” Sandberg said, “but we’ve got some hard work ahead of us.”

Skeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.

“He wouldn’t be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn’t strong enough to stand alone,” Martin said. “He must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.”

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Zuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).

The 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook’s ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple’s changes.

That may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn’t solvable with AI.

“I’m old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,” said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. “Social networks are switchable, right?”

When you look at Meta’s user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is “not in a good position.”

## ‘Force for good or evil’

The last time Facebook’s market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).

The main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).

[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including “What Great Brands Do” and “Fusion,” said there’s little evidence to suggest that Facebook’s rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.

“I think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,” Yohn said.

Rehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino’s Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company’s kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.

In December 2009, Domino’s launched a marketing blitz called the [“Pizza Turnaround.”](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.

Yohn said the company’s approach was, “We’ve been told our pizzas suck, and so we’re actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people’s perceptions.” While it sounded initially like “just marketing speak,” Yohn said, “they actually really did change.”

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, is not “coming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he’s envisioning,” she said.

Meta’s reputational hit could also harm the company’s ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.

A former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it’s viewed as having less “moral downside.”

[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he’s seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.

In order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are “having to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.”

## The bull case

Still, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Dollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company’s ability to move “from the PC to the mobile world.” Facebook’s mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.

Zuckerberg’s success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse. In the second quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs division, which houses its virtual reality headsets and related technologies, generated $452 million in revenue, about 1.5% of total Meta sales, and [lost $2.8 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/meta-reality-labs-lost-2point8-billion-in-q2-2022.html#:~:text=Meta%20lost%20%242.8%20billion%20on%20its%20virtual%20reality%20ambitions%20during%20Q2,-Published%20Wed%2C%20Jul&amp;amp;text=Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20lost%20%242.8,the%20quarter%20ending%20in%20June.).

“I think Zuckerberg is very bright and very ambitious,” said Dollarhide. “I wouldn’t bet against Zuckerberg just like I wouldn’t bet against [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/).”

Dollarhide’s firm hasn’t owned Facebook shares, though, since 2014, preferring the trajectory of tech companies such as Apple and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN), two of his top holdings.

“The reality is they can be perceived as a value company and not a growth company,” Dollarhide said, regarding Meta.

No matter what happens in the next year or two or even three, Zuckerberg has made clear that the future of the company is in the metaverse, where he’s banking on new businesses forming around virtual reality.

Zhao, from University of Chicago, says there’s immense uncertainty surrounding the metaverse’s prospects.

“The real question is — are daily users ready for the metaverse yet?” Zhao said. “Is the underlying technology ready and mature enough to make that transition seamless? That’s a real question and that may not be all up to Facebook or Meta at this point.”

If Zuckerberg is right, perhaps 10 years from now Meta’s stock price from the depths of 2022 will look like the discount of the decade. And if that happens, predictions of a death spiral will be mocked like a 2012 [cover story from Barron’s](https://ritholtz.com/2012/09/barrons-covers-story-facebook-worth-15/), headlined “Facebook is worth $15” with a thumb pointing down. Four years later, it was trading near $130.

Reuters new article headline: Tesla's third-quarter deliveries miss estimates

Source: https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1576607956531122179

Oct 2 - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Sunday announced lower-than-expected electric vehicle deliveries in the third quarter, as logistical challenges overshadowed its record deliveries.

Tesla delivered 343,830 electric vehicles, a record for the world's most valuable automaker, but less than the 359,162 analysts on average had expected, according to Refinitiv. A year earlier Tesla delivered 241,300 units.

The latest deliveries fell short of Tesla's production of 365,923 vehicles, which is rare for the automaker which has seen its deliveries higher or similar to production in many of recent quarters.

---------
The numbers:

-Deliveries 343,830, +42% y/y, estimate 357,938  
-Model S/X deliveries 18,672 vs. 9,275 y/y, estimate 16,092  
-Production 365,923 vehicles, +54% y/y, estimate 359,853  
-Model 3/Y production 345,988, +51% y/y, estimate 356,694 (2 estimates)

1664788557,4,"I was reading this [post](https://www.man.com/maninstitute/inflation-what-the-academic-research-says) by the Man Institute and realized that there are companies in certain kind of business that can help the government &amp; policy makers help build real-time inflation indices, which in turn would help the government &amp; policy makers make decisions that benefit the people that actually require them. The companies can - 

1. Make this real - time data available publicly so that there is transparency and users do not feel like their data is being exploited
2. Data can be anonymous and not on an individual basis, and can be aggregated to show which products &amp; services are purchased by the majority and which products &amp; services are basic necessities versus luxury products &amp; services

Examples - 

* Consider an example where majority of the people purchase groceries from Amazon, and the prices of which have increased 100%. Now the government &amp; policy makers can further analyze if this increase in groceries is due to increase in cost of seeds or an increase in cost of fertilizers or an increase in cost of fuel for transport or probably an increase in all of them. After they have determined the causes for higher prices, they can work on mitigating the causes through lower taxes, or some kind of subsidy, or working on different sourcing contracts.

1. E-Commerce companies - such as Amazon has data on the goods &amp; services that people purchase. It can use this data to actually show how the purchasing power of customers is affected in real time and using the kind of goods &amp; services that are purchased. The reason for their increase in prices can also be determined. If the root cause of inflation can be determined and how it hurts specific goods then the government &amp; policy makers can take appropriate actions. 
2. Payment Gateway companies - such as Mastercard &amp; Visa can do the same thing as Amazon which has been described above.
3. Real Estate Aggregators - such as Zillow can give out rental and sales data which can be used as described above.
4. Companies such as Google and Facebook may not be able to provide accurate data as the above 3, because the above 3 are final purchases whereas Google and Facebook might be used to search for options or browse through the available options.

I obviously haven't thought about it thoroughly, and your opinions, ideas, and criticisms are more than welcome, Cheers!**","reading ( man institute realized companies certain kind business help government policy makers help build real-time inflation indices, turn would help government policy makers make decisions benefit people actually require them. companies - 1. make real - time data available publicly transparency users feel like data exploited 2. data anonymous individual basis, aggregated show products services purchased majority products services basic necessities versus luxury products services examples - * consider example majority people purchase groceries amazon, prices increased 100%. government policy makers analyze increase groceries due increase cost seeds increase cost fertilizers increase cost fuel transport probably increase them. determined causes higher prices, work mitigating causes lower taxes, kind subsidy, working different sourcing contracts. 1. e-commerce companies - amazon data goods services people purchase. use data actually show purchasing power customers affected real time using kind goods services purchased. reason increase prices also determined. root cause inflation determined hurts specific goods government policy makers take appropriate actions. 2. payment gateway companies - mastercard visa thing amazon described above. 3. real estate aggregators - zillow give rental sales data used described above. 4. companies google facebook may able provide accurate data 3, 3 final purchases whereas google facebook might used search options browse available options. **note - thought immediately posted here. obviously thought thoroughly, opinions, ideas, criticisms welcome, cheers!**","['the Man Institute', 'post](https://www.man.com', 'Amazon', 'Mastercard', 'Google', 'Visa']"
1664799956,13,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week, month and quarter and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, October 3rd, 2022-

*****

# [Dow futures rise as Wall Street tries to recover from tough September](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher Monday as Wall Street tried to start the new month, and quarter, on a solid note.
*****
&gt; Dow futures traded 164 points higher, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were flat.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell further, after finishing the previous week 18 basis points down from its mid-week high.
*****
&gt; “It’s pretty simple at this point, 10-year Treasury yield goes up, and equities likely remain under pressure,” Raymond James’ Tavis McCourt said. “It comes down, and equities rally.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a tough month, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notching their biggest monthly losses since March 2020. The Dow on Friday also closed below below 29,000 for the first time since November 2020.
*****
&gt; The Dow shed 8.8% in September, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 9.3% and 10.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; For the quarter, the Dow fell 6.66% to notch a three-quarter losing streak for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite fell 5.28% and 4.11%, respectively, to finish their third consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2009.
*****
&gt; As the new quarter kicks off, all S&amp;P 500 sectors sit at least 10% off their 52-week highs. Nine sectors finished the quarter in negative territory.
*****
&gt; In the fourth quarter, elevated inflation and a Federal Reserve intent on bringing surging prices to a halt regardless of what it means for the economy will likely continue to weigh on markets, said Truist’s Keith Lerner. Oversold conditions, however, also make the market vulnerable to a sharp short-term bounce on good news, he added.
*****
&gt; “I think we could be set up for some type of reprieve but the underlying trend at this point is still a downward trend and choppy waters to continue,” Lerner said.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, Markit PMI and ISM manufacturing data are slated for release on Monday along with construction spending.

The maker of Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers handed over 343,830 vehicles to customers in the last three months, short of the almost 358,000 total that analysts expected. The stock fell 8.2% at 11:20 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday decline since June 16.

Tesla has for years delivered big batches of vehicles toward the end of each quarter, a practice Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tried to move away from by localizing production in all major regions. While the carmaker opened its first European factory in Germany in March, record shipping costs are still bedeviling the auto industry along with shortages of semiconductors and other components.

1664861336,129,"With all the talk of the latest Tesla robot demo I just want to give people a view behind the curtain.

Early tech demos of products that aren't market ready are very often smoke and mirrors.  100% of the time if they are performed in front of stakeholders they are highly scripted and many times that scripting is designed to follow a ""happy path"" that often hides considerable shortcomings in the product as it exists.  The most famous example of this is the first generation iPhone demo by Steve Jobs.  Here's some description of what was going on behind the scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The iPhone could play a section of a song or a video, but it couldn’t play an entire clip reliably without crashing. It worked fine if you sent an e-mail and then surfed the Web. If you did those things in reverse, however, it might not. Hours of trial and error had helped the iPhone team develop what engineers called “the golden path,” a specific set of tasks, performed in a specific way and order, that made the phone look as if it worked. 

 

&gt;They had AT&amp;T, the iPhone’s wireless carrier, bring in a portable cell tower, so they knew reception would be strong. Then, with Jobs’s approval, they preprogrammed the phone’s display to always show five bars of signal strength regardless of its true strength.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;None of these kludges fixed the iPhone’s biggest problem: it often ran out of memory and had to be restarted if made to do more than a handful of tasks at a time. Jobs had a number of demo units onstage with him to manage this problem. If memory ran low on one, he would switch to another while the first was restarted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say everything worked out for Apple in the end and the iPhone was a massive success, but it doesn't always go that way.

A personal anecdote, I worked on a multimillion dollar project for a fortune 100 company.  By the time I came on the project as a contractor to right the ship it was already a garbage pile on top of a toxic waste dump.  The C-level was losing patience and it was clear the project was doomed to fail but about a month in we were asked to walk them through a demo no matter what and told jobs were on the line.  Our contractors had a lot of startup experience going into this unlike the rest of the team we were supplementing so we knew what to do.  We basically hard coded functionality in the software all over the place and inserted custom values in the database that would not have been possible for users to add through the actual program anytime in the near future and made it look like the project was making considerable progress. I reality it was easily still a year or two away from being able to actually do the things we made it do and several more from being what they actually wanted.  I created a complete script, click here, click here, open this, step by step, and if you fuck up the program is going to crash.  The team's lead manager learned the script like the back of his hand and walked through the demo in the C-suite and the project got funded for another six months.  The in-house engineering team called us ""the Wizards of Oz.""  Six months later it predictably melted down and everyone packed it up to move to the next thing. A couple executives lost their cushy 7 figure jobs as a result.  This is EXTREMELY common.  

That was the most glaring example but I have done this same thing or seen it done dozens of times and several of those were walked out in front of investors.  Many of those products never even came close to the capabilities we scripted into the demo.  I would be shocked if a single early demo from any tech company doesn't have piles of hard coded garbage in some intermediate build just to get through the demo, then it's up to the engineers to just figure it out later.

It's very easy to spoof your way through showing off a new phone's planned features or make a robot slow walk a circle on a stage.  It's about 100x harder to make a phone that someone can actually use like a phone or make a robot that can do actual work and doesn't fall over and die when it steps on a Lego.  I just want to make people aware that this is how the tech world operates since reading some of the comments I've seen after big flashy tech demos I realize this is not common knowledge.

Sometimes the engineers will push through and you will end up with an iPhone but a lot of times by the time the demo comes around everyone in the back knows the project is already doomed and they are just trying to extract value from something they've already sunk millions into or they secretly know that it will easily take years to get the product to the usable state portrayed in the demo and are trying to excite investors.  Some of these projects you will never see or hear mentioned ever again and it's even more common in hardware products than software.  

This is just a friendly warning to take all tech demos with a giant grain of salt.","talk latest tesla robot demo want give people view behind curtain. early tech demos products market ready often smoke mirrors. 100% time performed front stakeholders highly scripted many times scripting designed follow ""happy path"" often hides considerable shortcomings product exists. famous example first generation iphone demo steve jobs. here's description going behind scenes. #x200b; &gt;the iphone could play section song video, couldn’t play entire clip reliably without crashing. worked fine sent e-mail surfed web. things reverse, however, might not. hours trial error helped iphone team develop engineers called “the golden path,” specific set tasks, performed specific way order, made phone look worked. &gt;they att, iphone’s wireless carrier, bring portable cell tower, knew reception would strong. then, jobs’s approval, preprogrammed phone’s display always show five bars signal strength regardless true strength. #x200b; &gt;none kludges fixed iphone’s biggest problem: often ran memory restarted made handful tasks time. jobs number demo units onstage manage problem. memory ran low one, would switch another first restarted. #x200b; needless say everything worked apple end iphone massive success, always go way. personal anecdote, worked multimillion dollar project fortune 100 company. time came project contractor right ship already garbage pile top toxic waste dump. c-level losing patience clear project doomed fail month asked walk demo matter told jobs line. contractors lot startup experience going unlike rest team supplementing knew do. basically hard coded functionality software place inserted custom values database would possible users add actual program anytime near future made look like project making considerable progress. reality easily still year two away able actually things made several actually wanted. created complete script, click here, click here, open this, step step, fuck program going crash. team's lead manager learned script like back hand walked demo c-suite project got funded another six months. in-house engineering team called us ""the wizards oz."" six months later predictably melted everyone packed move next thing. couple executives lost cushy 7 figure jobs result. extremely common. glaring example done thing seen done dozens times several walked front investors. many products never even came close capabilities scripted demo. would shocked single early demo tech company piles hard coded garbage intermediate build get demo, engineers figure later. easy spoof way showing new phone's planned features make robot slow walk circle stage. 100x harder make phone someone actually use like phone make robot actual work fall die steps lego. want make people aware tech world operates since reading comments seen big flashy tech demos realize common knowledge. sometimes engineers push end iphone lot times time demo comes around everyone back knows project already doomed trying extract value something already sunk millions secretly know easily take years get product usable state portrayed demo trying excite investors. projects never see hear mentioned ever even common hardware products software. friendly warning take tech demos giant grain salt.","['EXTREMELY', 'Lego', 'iPhone', 'Apple', 'Jobs’s']"

# [Stock futures jump as traders try to build on Monday’s rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures surged Tuesday as Wall Street aimed to build on a sharp rally seen in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 335 points, or 1.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures increased 1.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.8%.
*****
&gt; Monday brought a respite from slides seen throughout September and the prior quarter. The Dow jumped nearly 2.7%, or about 765 points. It was its best day since June 24. The S&amp;P 500 advanced about 2.6% in its best day since July 27. The Nasdaq Composite increased roughly 2.3%.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note extended its decline and was trading at about 3.583%, down from more than 4% at one point last week.
*****
&gt; “After falling more than 9% in September and extending its year-to-date decline to nearly 25% as of Friday’s close, we think the S&amp;P 500 was looking oversold,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “In addition, some of last week’s selling pressure may have been driven by quarter-end rebalancing, which has now ended.”
*****
&gt; “With sentiment toward equities already very weak, periodic rebounds are to be expected,” he added. “But markets are likely to stay volatile in the near term, driven primarily by expectations around inflation and policy rates.”
*****
&gt; Investors will watch for new data Tuesday from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

&gt; The Dow on Tuesday jumped about 825 points, or 2.8%. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 3.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.3%. Those gains, which come on the back of falling bond yields, led to the strongest two-day stretch for the S&amp;P 500 since 2020.
*****

https://insideevs.com/news/614726/tesla-megapacks-hawaii-arrive-coal-is-finished/

As an alternative to the energy gap left behind by the coal power plant, Plus Power LLC  is using Tesla Megapacks to build a large battery energy storage system (BESS) in the state of Hawaii.

This sustainable energy project is named Kapolei Energy Storage (KES). KES is one of the world’s largest battery energy storage systems, featuring a capacity of 565 MWh. It will be charged using a 156 MW solar energy farm.

State-owned Hawaiian Electric estimates the completion of the KES project in the first half of 2023. According to the state’s electricity supply company, 9 BESS projects are scheduled to go live by 2024 on the island of Oahu alone (FAQ PDF by Hawaiian Electric).

“Last coal shipment arrived in Hawaii at the same time as Tesla Megapack batteries that will enable 24/7 sustainable energy,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a recent tweet.","tesla's megapack battery system stepping fulfill state’s power requirements, following end 30-year deal september 1 hawaiian electric aes corporation provide coal power (via hawaiian electric). alternative energy gap left behind coal power plant, plus power llc using tesla megapacks build large battery energy storage system (bess) state hawaii. sustainable energy project named kapolei energy storage (kes). kes one world’s largest battery energy storage systems, featuring capacity 565 mwh. charged using 156 mw solar energy farm. state-owned hawaiian electric estimates completion kes project first half 2023. according state’s electricity supply company, 9 bess projects scheduled go live 2024 island oahu alone (faq pdf hawaiian electric). “last coal shipment arrived hawaii time tesla megapack batteries enable 24/7 sustainable energy,” tesla ceo elon musk said recent tweet.","['KES', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Tesla Megapack', 'MW', 'PDF', 'Tesla', 'AES Corporation', 'NextEra Energy']"

1665327845,2,"This week's casual valuation is Bark, a company that's down more than 85% since it became public back in December 2020. It's a small-cap company with a market cap of close to $320m and is not (yet) profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

The post will be divided into a few segments:

1. Understanding the business
2. Understanding the historical financial performance
3. Laying down some assumptions to value the company
4. Valuing the company based on assumptions significantly different than mine

**What is Bark?**

If the name itself wasn't explaining enough, it is a dog-centric company, selling products in the US in 4 different categories:

\- Play (Toys/treats)

\- Food

\- Health (Treat-like dental sticks &amp; gel toothpaste)

\- Home (Dog beds, bowls, collars, leashes)

Is it revolutionary? Not really, there's nothing special about the products that they're offering, in fact, it is a pretty simple company to understand. However, there are two things that stand out:

1. There are subscription plans where the dog owners receive a monthly package, tailored to the dog (based on breed and certain characteristics). These packages can be either related to toys/treats or food. The # of subscriptions increased significantly:- March 2015 - 200k- March 2019 - 1,046m- March 2022 - 2,265mAgain, nothing revolutionary, and any company that is in this industry can offer the subscription model. It is a model that can be easily replicated.
2. Over 90% of their revenue is generated DTC (Direct-to-consumer) through their websites, hence, their margins are higher than if they were to sell the same products through a 3rd party.

So, we are now aware of the products that they sell, but we still need to uncover how they do it.

The manufacturing of the products as well as the logistics (including delivery to the final customer) are being outsourced. The company is only involved in the R&amp;D, Marketing/Sales activities as well as preparing the orders. For that purpose, they have 3 leased office spaces (1 in New York and 2 in Ohio) and 3 leased warehouse and distribution centers (in Ohio, Kentucky, and Nevada).

As of 31st March 2022, they had 643 employees, divided into 5 buckets:

\- 227 Bank ambassadors (employees responsible for customer service, dealing with orders/complaints)

\- 125 Marketing, general &amp; administrative

\- 102 Operations &amp; fulfillment center employees

\- 96 Engineers, data scientists &amp; technology staff

\- 93 Designers &amp; creative team members

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of mixed reviews when it comes to the company's products (including the subscription model). There are quite a lot of satisfied customers, but there are also plenty of others that are either unhappy with the quality of the contents of the package (for example, the dog destroyed the toy within 24 hours), and oftentimes regarding the package being late. Although that is being outsourced to a third-party company, Bark is ultimately responsible for customer satisfaction.

Toys as a product aren't something that is needed monthly. There comes a time when an additional toy doesn't add value to the collection of toys accumulated over time. Hence, the company has a 7% monthly churn rate and this doesn't come as surprise.

The company's fiscal year-end is March 31st (this date was mentioned a couple of times above) and the latest quarterly report is as of June 30th, 2022. Therefore, when I'm referring to the year 2022, that is the period between April 1st, 2021 to March 31st, 2022, and when I'm referring to the last twelve months (""LTM""), that would be the period between July 1st, 2021 up to June 30th, 2022.

The revenue increased from $224m in 2020 to $379 in 2021, representing a growth of 69% as the company became public. If there's one thing that's well-known about companies that become public, is that their recent historical performance is better than their performance in the near future.

Bark was no different in that aspect, the growth to 2022 declined to 34% and the projected growth for 2023 is 10%. This explains the decline of the share price to a large extent. When a company goes public, the starting point for future expectations is its recent past performance. However, when there's a significant deviation from that, the price adjusts.

The gross margin was relatively stable (between 56% and 61%), which is quite good for a company at this stage. But, there's a minor catch and we'll get to that in a bit.

The other operating expenses that the company has to cover are :

\- General &amp; Administrative (which grew from 52% of revenue back in 2020 to 60% in LTM) and;

\- Advertising &amp; Marketing (which decreased from 21% of revenue back in 2020 to 14% in LTM)

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to a negative operating margin ranging from -12% (back in 2020) to -18% in LTM.

&amp;#x200B;

It isn't surprising for a high-growth company at this stage to lose money. The question is, how is it going to become profitable?

One of the arguments is economies of scale. In theory, as the company grows in size (in terms of revenue), the operating expenses grow at a slower pace, hence the margin improves over time. However, so far, that doesn't seem to be the case. Yes, the advertising &amp; marketing expenses did decrease (as % of revenue), but that isn't the case for general &amp; administrative and that's where the company needs to make the biggest improvements.

So, here's the catch:

There are so-called **fulfillment costs.** They represent those costs incurred in operating and staffing fulfillment and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting, picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment, outbound freight costs associated with shipping orders to customers, and responding to inquiries from customers.

Now, based on this description, what is your first thought about these costs? Where do they belong, what do they relate to?

In my opinion, these are direct, variable costs that will increase as the company grows in size. The more orders they have, the more products they need to ship, and the more it will cost them to receive, inspect, pick, package, and prepare customer orders as well as higher outbound freight costs.

However, these costs (amounting to $53m in 2020, $95m in 2021, and $151m in 2022) are part of **GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE** expenses.

So, what I did was, I shifted them to the cost of goods sold, to better understand the impact on the gross margin. The outcome --&gt; Gross margin close to 30%.

Now that gives a different perspective on the company's profitability as well as the operating margin that I can expect when it's a mature company.

The company provides nice overviews when it comes to subscriptions, customer acquisition cost (""CAC""), and the LTV (""Lifetime value"").

For 2022, the CAC was $53.43, and the LTV was 4.7x.

What does this mean? If we multiply the two, we get to an LTV of around $250. That's the value that a customer will bring over their lifetime. This $250 is the gross profit that the customer will bring, based on the company's measure (which excludes the fulfillment costs mentioned above).

Is this illegal? Absolutely not. Bark publicly discloses its accounting policies and it has the right to use this approach. Do I agree with it? Not really.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

The company has a relatively simple balance sheet. Here are the key points as of 30th June 2022:

\- Cash of $177m

\- Inventory of $158m

\- PPE (including leases) of $75m

This represents over 90% of the entire balance sheet.

The debt position isn't significant consisting of $76m long-term debt and $53m leases.

**Assumptions about the future &amp; valuation**

There are only a few analysts that focus on this company as it's relatively small in size and not profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

My assumptions:

**- Revenue growth** of 10% for the next 3 years, then declining to 5% and then to 3.9% (same as the risk-free rate). The analysts' expectation involves 25% growth in 2024, which I personally cannot include in my forecast as I cannot fundamentally explain what can cause such a jump, hence, I am being more conservative.

**- Operating margin** of -10% for the next year, improving to 4% in year 5 and ultimately to 10% starting from year 7.

**- A discount rate of 10.51%** (WACC-based), decreasing to 9% over time (assuming the company becomes more mature and hence, less risky)

&amp;#x200B;

Based on these assumptions, the fair value of the company is $503m (**$2.85/share**).

The current market cap is $319m ($1.81/share).

*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.*

However, out of the $503m, only $48m is due to the present value of the cash flows in the next 10 years! The majority is based on the value that the company generates afterward as a stable, mature, profitable company.

Hence, the fact that it is trading below what I consider intrinsic value is justified to some extent. There's a lot of uncertainty and Bark still needs to prove that it can find its way to profitability.

It is definitely reassuring that the company's management is buying and not selling shares.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 76% to $927m in 10 years and the operating margin will be 10%.

I am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue/Op. margin|8%|10%|15%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|50% ($782m)|$1.8|$2.5|$3.9|$5.4|
|78% ($927m)|$2.1$|$2.9|$4.5|$6.3|
|100% ($1,042m)|$2.3|$3.2|$5.1|$7.0|
|150% ($1,303m)|$2.8|$3.9|$6.2|$8.7|

&amp;#x200B;

The table illustrates how much the company needs to grow and how high should the operating margin be so that Intuit is fairly valued today.

The last column of 20% would've been appropriate if the gross margin of 55% included all the expenses. Since that's not the case, if the company is to become profitable (which is yet to be proven), I could only forecast an operating margin as high as 10%. Is it possible that it gets to 15%? Absolutely!

The company has a good customer base built, so it wouldn't be surprising if another company acquires it.

1665384131,45,"Mohnish Pobrai for a long time has been beloved by the value investing community. As a Buffett disciple, he has been mentioned for years in value communities for his simple “cloning” style and his nice sound bites and quotes.

However, what he has NOT been known for, is outperformance. I will caveat this with the fact that we can only truly know for sure the performance of his US investments as that is what is required to be reported in 13-F filings. 

According to TipRanks, which tracks investors 13-F filings, Mohnish has returned -58% over the last 10 years and ranks 403 of 462 funds that they track. That’s right, in 10 years since 2012 the S&amp;P gained 212% and Mohnish’s fund is down 58%. For those that will say “he’s a long term investor”, 10 years with over 300% underperformance is plenty of runway, but I have more proof that he is in fact not a long term investor. 

Beyond just his poor performance, let’s look at his track record.

- BABA - As we know Mohnish is a “cloner”, and followed Charlie Munger into BABA in early 2021. He talked about it in interviews how amazing the business was and how misunderstood Chinese tech companies are. He then rode the stock down over 50% until Q3 2021, when he sold entirely for “tax loss harvesting” and because he claims he likes Tencent better. Taking a 50% haircut in 6 months then selling for tax reasons doesn’t sound like things many “long term investors” I know do.

- SRG - Mohnish has been proudly pushing Seritage Growth Properties for awhile now saying how deeply undervalued it is. He first bought in Q1 2016, then sold all in Q2 2017…another loss and another short holding period. He then doubled down on SRG again in Q2 2020, again touting how it’s a long term hold…only to sell it again in Q1 2022, this time for a gain but still off from its 2021 highs. He sold claiming that the businesses debt and time it would take the restructure its properties became too complicated, again something I feel a value investor takes into account before buying.

- EAF - Mohnish made a huge splash buying the little known Graftech (EAF) in Q2 2019. He claimed the small business had a monopoly on its specific process of electric arc furnaces and has the type of competitive advantage he looks for in businesses. Apparently he changed his mind, because only 9 months and 30% down later, he sold his entire position. 

GOOG - Bought and owned GOOG for a few years from 2015-2018, but sold in 2018 and missed a 200%+ run up in the stock

Mohnish now has been touting his idea that he likes to invest in “spawners”, businesses like Amazon or Google that are massive FCF machines and use that FCF to “spawn” new businesses within them. Interesting that he is currently 100% invested in MU, a business that is clearly not a spawner, and one that he is only up around 30% on over 3 years. 

I’m not the only one who feels this way, his investors do too. His fund has dramatically reduced in size, from $540M AUM in 2013 all the way down to $100M AUM in 2022. Massive reduction caused by both outflows and fund performance.

I feel that Mohnish says many of the right things and gives value investors a lot of nice simple sound bites about investing, but that in reality he is a fake guru that is great in interviews but not so great at investing.","mohnish pobrai long time beloved value investing community. buffett disciple, mentioned years value communities simple “cloning” style nice sound bites quotes. however, known for, outperformance. caveat fact truly know sure performance us investments required reported 13-f filings. according tipranks, tracks investors 13-f filings, mohnish returned -58% last 10 years ranks 403 462 funds track. that’s right, 10 years since 2012 sp gained 212% mohnish’s fund 58%. say “he’s long term investor”, 10 years 300% underperformance plenty runway, proof fact long term investor. beyond poor performance, let’s look track record. - baba - know mohnish “cloner”, followed charlie munger baba early 2021. talked interviews amazing business misunderstood chinese tech companies are. rode stock 50% q3 2021, sold entirely “tax loss harvesting” claims likes tencent better. taking 50% haircut 6 months selling tax reasons doesn’t sound like things many “long term investors” know do. - srg - mohnish proudly pushing seritage growth properties awhile saying deeply undervalued is. first bought q1 2016, sold q2 2017…another loss another short holding period. doubled srg q2 2020, touting it’s long term hold…only sell q1 2022, time gain still 2021 highs. sold claiming businesses debt time would take restructure properties became complicated, something feel value investor takes account buying. - eaf - mohnish made huge splash buying little known graftech (eaf) q2 2019. claimed small business monopoly specific process electric arc furnaces type competitive advantage looks businesses. apparently changed mind, 9 months 30% later, sold entire position. goog - bought owned goog years 2015-2018, sold 2018 missed 200%+ run stock mohnish touting idea likes invest “spawners”, businesses like amazon google massive fcf machines use fcf “spawn” new businesses within them. interesting currently 100% invested mu, business clearly spawner, one around 30% 3 years. i’m one feels way, investors too. fund dramatically reduced size, $540m aum 2013 way $100m aum 2022. massive reduction caused outflows fund performance. feel mohnish says many right things gives value investors lot nice simple sound bites investing, reality fake guru great interviews great investing.","['Seritage Growth Properties', 'Amazon', 'GOOG - Bought', 'FCF', 'Mohnish', 'EAF', 'MU', 'SRG', 'GOOG', 'Graftech', 'Google', 'Alibaba Group', 'Mohnish’s', 'TipRanks']"

This company has some popular brands that repair your hair's bonds. 

**Qualitative remarks:** 

Visit Amazon, Ulta, or Sephora websites, and look at their hair/shampoo sections and note what the top brands are. [For Amazon you might have to explicitly go to shampoo, but hair should suffice for the latter two]. This company's products are wildly popular on TikTok and in hair salons (apparently). They saw some 3B views in their recent TikTok campaign.

I am not too worried about a recession. People care deeply about their hair, so will pay for premium products if they work. The retail versions sell for $30 while the professional ones are around $200. And hair salons like it a lot.Other luxury/cosmetic companies such as Ulta and EL have had excellent financials in the past even during tougher times. (Ulta has crushed SPY in the last decade)

I am not an expert on hair care, so I couldn't say much more about the exact use cases of OLPX. I think people who bleach or color their hair especially use it to repair the quality of their hair. Nevertheless, it's extremely popular (you can visit the hair/cosmetic subreddits to also see it discussed a lot). I also recommend asking your lady friends about it too.

**Quantitative**:

- Valuation: The stock has cheapened substantially from its earlier valuations, falling 70% YTD while the fundamentals only improved. Currently it trades at a 24 PE trailing and 17 PE forward. EV/EBIDTA is 14. This appears to be about the same or much cheaper than its peers (COTY, EPC, IPAR, SKIN, NTCO). Those tend to have higher PEs but about the same EV/EBITDA.

- Net income growth was 36% y.o.y. in Q1 and 77% y.o.y. in Q2 of this year. 

- Revenue growth was 58% y.o.y. in Q1 and 38% y.o.y. in Q2.

- Balance Sheet: It's cash position is around 200M, compared to total long term debt of 700M.

- Cashflow: It's FCF positive, seeing between 55M to 70M each of the last 4 quarters. Annual cash flows in 2019, 2020, and 2021 where: 52.56M, 128.95M, and 199.15M. We're already at 128M for 2022, with two quarters left to go.

# [Stock futures fall to start week with key inflation data, earnings ahead](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/09/stock-futures-are-down-as-market-exits-rollercoaster-week.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower Monday morning as the markets come out of a tumultuous week and traders look ahead to key reports coming in the next week that can offer insights into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 28 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were lower by 0.18%, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.30%.
*****
&gt; Market observers generally consider the week ahead as the kickoff to earnings season, with four of the world’s largest banks – JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citi – reporting Friday. PepsiCo, Delta and Domino’s are also among companies reporting next week.
*****
&gt; Inflation will also take center stage as new monthly Consumer Price Index data comes Thursday morning.
*****
&gt; It will follow a week of whiplash for market participants. The first half of the week brought a relief rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 up more than 5% in its largest two-day gain since 2020.
*****
&gt; But jobs data that economists say will keep the Federal Reserve on a path to continue raising interest rates and OPEC+’s decision to slash oil supply rattled investors, knocking the market down later in the week. When trading ended Friday, the S&amp;P was up 1.5% compared to where it started the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were up 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Still, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq had the first positive week in the last four. All remain down substantially so far in 2022, however, and the Nasdaq is less than 1% away from its 52-week low.
*****
&gt; “The direction of the stock market is likely to be lower because either the economy and corporate profits are going to slow meaningfully or the Fed is going to have to raise rates even higher and keep them higher for longer,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Given the conditions that we are operating under, we believe it’s prudent to begin preparing for a recession,” he added. “The talk of a shallow recession that is now the narrative-du-jour strikes us as eerily similar to the ‘inflation is transitory’ narrative of last year.”
*****
&gt; Last week brought heightened concerns that corporate earnings will show the ugly side of a surging dollar as Levi Strauss became the latest to cut guidance due to sliding international sales.

*I am a Business Economy &amp; Management Student and i recently found i passion for Financial Analysis, Indeed, i would like to become a Financial Analysts myself. I know i have lots to learn and many experience to cover, that is why i am practicing daily. I am sharing my exercises so i can get opinions, advices and indications, and surely this will help every one intended to learn and improve!*

*Click* [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQLUA4DW0MTjz-OY6EunKDqvCYFFdjLO/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=111541358396870593416&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true) *to check the Excel file where i did my math*

# Some Briefing

I made adjustments and fixed some numbers from my last analysis. The Final Price is the average of all the evaluation methods listed.

* *Graham Fair Value Formula*
* *CFO Evaluation*
* *Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow*
* *Dividend Discount Model*
* *Total Payout Valuation Model*

**Changes from the previous post:**

* **Use of Annual Data**: In the last one I used quarterly data and forecasted it as it was annual lol (what an idiot)
* **Use of Unlevered Free Cash Flow**: I used Free Cash flow to do DCF in the last one
* **Use of Growth Rate calculated by me**
* **Tax of 8.46%** calculated by me, in the last one i just guessed one randomly loool
* **Fixed Unlevered Beta**: Used MCap and Long tern &amp; Short Term Debt to calculate Unlevered Beta instead of using Shareholders Equity

**Final Introductory Notes:**

* **I did not compare Intel to is competitors** nor the industry sector, i plan to, this is just a quick analysis
* **I didn't do the Scenario Analysis** to forecast the revenue from Intel's product segments, i factored all the possible variations in sales with a conservative estimate of the company growth of 0.71%, the number is based on its last year's net earnings. The growth rate of 0.71% is used in every valuation methods used. Note: Analysts growth rate for the next 5 years for Intel is: -0.16%
* To better calculate the growth rate, i need the percentage of earnings that are not distributed to investors. I calculated the retained one as 71.59% and the distributed portion of 28.41%. I am not sure if this is correct, thus i assumed a retention rate of 5% to be conservative, if you have some indication please do not restrain yourself thanks!
* In the Dividend Discount Model, i used the calculated company growth rate of **0.71%** and not the average of the last 9 years of 5.64%. This is due to the fact that i see it as an unreasonable growth rate for dividend for the next near future. This model is based of Gordon's Growth Model (with constant growth in dividend).
* **As Discount Rate, i used mainly CAPM** form most of the evaluation methods, even tho is calculated WACC, i used it only for the Total Payment Valuation Method.
* **I made also a Risk Analysis**, but i think it is fucked up, and thus it shall not be considered at all and skipped lol
* **Company has a cash burn rate of 0.50** and 6 months remaing, i dont know why, it seems odd not gonna lie but i still have to figure out what is wrong. Is is calculated on FCF of 9,662,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands :/

# Ratios

*Quick Note: this is just indicative, i know i need more ratios and i need to compare them with industry and competitors to better have an adjusted commentary on Intel's ratios, in the next post i will add more ratios like: ROIC, Accounts Receivable Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Accounts Payable Turnover, Debt to Equity, Quick Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio, Price to Book ratio, P/E etc (this list is not biding, some ratio listed could be not included), i will try to compare some with its historical variations.*

|Ratio|Numbers|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Working Capital**|2.10|The company can cover its short term expenses with its current assets|
|**Acid Test**|0.18|The company cannot cover its short term expenses with only its cash and cash equivalents|

Note: The Ratios section can be skipped.

# Risk Analysis

Following are factors that can impact the company Free Cash Flow:

* **Inflation rate increases**: Last Month's inflation decreased just a little bit, but that doesn't indicate that it will plunge soon, high probability to see it increase in the near future.
* **Unanticipated effects of interest rate hikes**: We know that the FED is trying everything to fight inflation, even spending and injecting more cash in the economy! We expected the last rates hike, and we expect another one soon.
* **Geopolitical events**: one word: \*reads it with Trump's voice\* ***China!***
* **Sales forecast, cost estimates, and cash conversion cycle inaccuracy**: It is forecasted by Intel itself a decrease on sales for the next near future due to demand decrease.
* **New competitors entering the market or taking market share**: AMD is smashing it and Intel is stagnating.

**Risk in Numbers (a historical overview)**

By observing the yearly variation of its Free Cash Flow, we can extrapolate some statistics.

* Average variation of Free Cash Flow for the last 10y: **8.18%**
* Variance of the data set: **10.57%**
* Standard Deviation: **32.51%**

# Comments on the Valuation Methods used

|Method|Comment|
|:-|:-|
|**Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula**|Used in Value Investing taking in count EPS, growth rate and AAA bond yield. As for Intel's current situation, its value shall be round $33.14 in normal market conditions.|
|**FCF Evaluation**|Taking in mind CFO for 29,991,000 thousands, CapEx of 20,329,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands, Fair Value is 38.98 in Normal market conditions.

|**Discounted Unlevelead Free Cash Flow**|This model observe past Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Forecast the growth of it for the next 5 years.

The value is calculated assuming that the current market condition persists for the next 5 years.|
|**Dividend Discount Model**|This model observes the historical variation of Yearly Dividends. It is based on the principle that a Company Value is due to the Present Value of all its future dividends. Gordon's Growth Model is the DDM assuming a constant growth of the dividend and this DDM is based on that assumption. The fact that 5% growth is not sustainable in current market condition, i sued the calculated growth rate that i made, 0.71%, giving us a Value of $24.09 assuming a constant growth of dividend by that rate. This is conservative estimate.|
|**Total Payout Valuation Model**|This method is an alternative to DDM and try to extrapolate the Fair Value from its dividend payout. This method is the only one where i used WACC as discount rate. Why? cause the formula i got raid WACC instead of a general ""discount rate"" loooool.|

# Conclusions

As i stated, **this is just a preliminary analysis**, *i still have to integrate some data, ratios and take in mind many other variables!*

Intel is surely lagging behind it competitors and falling in the ""***Too Big To Fail***"" mentality which makes them too complacent and lazy in doing things good. I can's comment on management cause i still have to check it. Short Term and Long Term Debts are increasing, surely due to this year shenanigans in the overall market. We can observe a small increase in Unleveread Free Cash Flow and PP&amp;E. The company so far has paid dividend regularly, so if it is in severe situation, we shall expect it to stop distributing earnings, until then, we shall not be alarmed.

**In conclusion**, *Intel is following market movements and is in a geopolitical crossfire, which affects is competitors too. We shall not forget that it is in danger regarding lagging really hard behind competitors, they need to invest more in R&amp;D and Marketing, cut inventories and operational expenses, i sense some inefficiency in the Business Structure.*

Shares of Albertsons jumped and were briefly halted on Thursday morning, after news that the supermarket chain may get acquired by grocery giant Kroger.

The companies may agree to a deal as soon as this week, but it is not final, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.

Bloomberg first reported the news, citing people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified since they were discussing confidential information.

The two companies could not be immediately reached by CNBC for comment.

Kroger is the largest supermarket operator in the country. It is made up of more than a dozen banners, including Fred Meyer, Ralphs, King Soopers, Harris Teeter and its namesake brand. It trails behind Walmart, which is the top grocer in the U.S. by revenue.

The talks come as competition in the grocery industry has intensified. About five years ago, Amazon spooked legacy grocers by acquiring Whole Foods. Its stores, which now include Amazon Fresh, [still command a small percentage of the overall U.S. grocery market](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/19/amazons-sprawling-grocery-business-has-become-an-expensive-hobby.html), but sparked a wave of investment.

Kroger, for example, struck a deal with British online grocer Ocado to build huge robot-powered fulfillment centers to pick and pack online grocery orders. It has used the new [business model to break into new markets, including Florida.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/kroger-is-taking-on-publix-in-florida-without-opening-a-single-grocery-store.html) It also plans to expand in the Northeast.

The pandemic also pushed the industry to better cater to customer preferences, with services such as curbside pickup and home delivery. Yet those investments have also pressured grocers’ profits. Already, the grocery business is known for its thin margins and inflation has driven up the costs of food.

1665698356,115,"There is a lot of fear in the market, the net bullish sentiment is very low, for example the AAII survey shows an investor almost as scared as in the months before 2008 bear market\`s bottom. 

I see too many guys talking about how you have to be greedy when others are fearful and how this is time to buy because of the terrible market sentiment. IMO this old (and good) advice only works when people **also** sell their riskier assets (stocks and junk bonds) to hold safer assets (cash, high quality bonds and some blue chips and passive ETFs). 

The problem is investors still hold huge amounts of stocks (60%+) , the junk  to AAA bonds spread is still very low and we keep having net cash **inflows** into the stock market. I hear about ""mid/low cap tech bargains"" all the time, investors keep seeking risky assets even if they are fearful...they are still trying to find the next Tesla! 

So, investors are scared but they are not looking for safe assets! Why? Maybe its all about inertia. In the last 15 years every time things looked bad the FED injected tons of money and bang! new ATH in a matter of months. Selling was always a mistake in the last 15 years, so investors are incredibly reluctant to sell even if they think the market will keep falling. 

In previous bear markets we see good buying opportunites happened when stock allocation levels fell below 50% (closer to 40%), a huge spike in AAA-to-junk bonds spread, massive outflows in the stock market and OC people talking about total collapse and the end of the western civilization instead of trying to find the next Apple. 

I feel like we are not nearly close to this point, I feel like we are not even close to the bottom yet! And I dont think there are good bargains right now.

Exxon Mobil is seeing [worker attrition](https://i.imgur.com/rSrQyoT.png) at levels above its peers in the oil &amp; gas industry, and especially more than other industries. [This long article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-13/exxon-xom-jobs-exodus-brings-scrutiny-to-corporate-culture?srnd=markets-vp) details the cultural issues plaguing Exxon Mobil.

&gt; A  year and a half later, even as its stock surges again and Exxon makes more money than it has in its 140-year history, the company has experienced the highest attrition since its merger with Mobil in 1999. Of the 12,000 departures globally in the past two years, less than half were from layoffs. 

For example: 

&gt; CultureX, an organization out of MIT that evaluates corporate culture based on Glassdoor reviews, says these problems run so deep that Exxon now ranks below industry benchmarks for 143 of the 196 cultural issues it measures. 

As an example, take their performance reviews:

&gt; Exxon’s performance ranking system, which pits employees against each other, dominates the day to day. Subordinates are told not to speak out against their bosses in meetings for fear of being placed at the bottom of the rank and pushed out. Employees are reluctant to raise problems or speak freely about environmental issues. Senior managers too often promote people who look and sound like themselves at the expense of technical experts willing to deliver hard messages, and some employees of color say they’ve been marginalized. “Agreeability to senior leadership has become more important than capability,” says one executive who left the company last year after two decades. “Unfortunately this accelerated during the pandemic.”


Example of its costs:

&gt; Chang, who joined Exxon in 2003 after getting a doctorate in mechanical engineering and who worked in Exxon research, says early on in his career he was brought in to give technical advice on a new project and spotted a potential problem, but a supervisor didn’t want to report it up the chain of command. Chang ended up using a formal reporting avenue to elevate his concerns and eventually got a hearing with the vice president of engineering, but by that point he’d already been taken off the project and dropped in the performance ranking. “My peers knew I was being punished,” he says.

This system is very unpredictable, since ""Now employees could rise to the top or fall to the bottom in a single year."" 

A leaked study showed massive overspending by Exxon over the decades ([link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/leaked-study-says-exxon-partners-overspent-by-138-billion-on-oil-gas-projects)).

This article suggests it is in part due to these cultural issues:

&gt; Within any major oil company, career advancement often lies in getting a project approved, which takes years. Persuading executives to commit billions of dollars to a project can catapult employees to the executive track, but it also has the potential to skew incentives. A 2020 internal Exxon study on “runaway projects” that exceeded early cost estimates by more than 70% suggested that they were “intentionally underestimated” during planning so they could get greenlighted. When projects inevitably suffered delays, individual teams would desperately try to get their parts of it back on track at the expense of the overall goal.

Employees were demoralized by layoffs that occurred while maintaining the 3rd largest dividend in the S&amp;P 500:

&gt; Like many American corporations, Exxon had been expanding service centers in Asia for some years, but it accelerated in 2020. Employees were asked to move any tasks they could to Bangalore or Kuala Lumpur, often having to personally train people they feared would ultimately replace them. By that fall, their fears were realized when Woods announced that Exxon would be laying off 15% of its global workforce, slashing its capital budget by about a third, or $10 billion, and freezing regular salary increases.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing Woods didn’t cut was Exxon’s dividend, which is the third-largest in the S&amp;P 500 and costs $15 billion a year. Employees recall the justification as basically this: A large portion of Exxon’s shareholder base comprised retail investors who relied on the dividend for income. “There might be many good business reasons to keep it, but don’t pretend to care about Grandma and her dividend when you’ve just fired thousands of employees,” says one former employee who quit in 2021 after more than a decade at Exxon.

The article has more examples, but I just wanted to sum up a few. As a final example, in a corporate townhall led by the global IT vice President, his response to employee's questions was:

&gt; If you want to be a “hotshot” and triple your pay working for Amazon, then go right ahead, the people recall him saying. “Good luck to you.”","edit: bullish xom, sharing article anyway exxon mobil seeing ( levels peers oil gas industry, especially industries.

The Federal Trade Commission’s officials traded stocks and funds more than those at any other major agency, including going heavily into tech shares, The Wall Street Journal found

WSJ Article 
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-regulators-of-facebook-google-and-amazon-also-invest-in-the-companies-stocks-11665670207

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as Amazon. com Inc., MetaPlatforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.

An FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and AT&amp;T Inc. while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors.

The head of the FTC’s international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas enforcement officials on an investigation involving Facebook.

And an FTC consumer-protection official owned stock in more than 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms.

1665800914,1110,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s flagship fund on Friday closed at its lowest level in five years, after suffering a 78% plunge from last year’s highs.

The ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) dropped 5.7%, finishing the day at $33.99 per share. The fund fell roughly 9.4% over the five-day stretch, its fifth straight weekly decline. 

“Nothing has changed in the larger macro backdrop -- a strong dollar is pressuring risk assets, inflation keeps surprising on the upside, rates are sticky and the Fed has to keep tightening,” said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas Securities. “All of that is a bad combo for high-growth stocks.”

The year hasn’t been kind to the $6.7 billion ETF, as top holdings like Tesla Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. were pummeled. Growth-oriented assets, like tech stocks or retail-trading favorite Tesla, have tanked as the Federal Reserve raises rates to knock down scorching levels of inflation. 

Wood took the central bank to task this week for its aggressive tightening campaign, penning an open letter to officials to express concern that they could be making a policy error. 

Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, Wood said the current risk-off environment means investors are looking for safety in passive benchmark-tracking products and failing to recognize that her fund’s investments are positioned for the long haul. Wood and her firm have often said they are focused on at least a five-year investment horizon.

Wood’s other funds have also been battered this year, with most dropping 40% or more. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) dropped 5.1% on Friday and closed at a record low.

1665963135,2," Okay everyone, I know there has been a lot of discussions regarding the bear market that we are in and that it will take forever to get back to ATH and so on, but I still see people writing “Should I sell now for a loss or sit it out?”, so obviously people are still deciding on what this is exactly.

My answer: **STAGFLATION** 

Why stagflation? There are several similarities to 1973 starting with a shortage in energy supply (oil and gas) continuing with inflation (hell yeah, Inflation is here after a looong time) and let’s not forget the falling GDP (GDP is in a straight decline, recession is here) and the rise in interest rates. All this is textbook stagflation. One more similarity is an ongoing war…

For those who are not familiar with stagflation, check out Investopedia: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp)

The most renowned stagflation period started 1973 when a shortage in oil supply led to spiking inflation. 1973 the inflation went up to almost 7.5 % and then slowly went back to 2,5% in 1978. So, 5 years before it came back down. It then spiked again and came back down to “normal” levels 1985, so 12 years after it all began. Here is the chart for Germany back then. 

Today Germany is hitting inflation numbers unseen since WWII. If we stay course the 1922/23 hyperinflation is the only period which had higher inflation than right now.

📷

Now let’s look at the MSCI World: from it’s high in 1972 / 1973 it came down almost 60% in two years, finally bottoming in 1975. Today, 1973 would be 2022 and is behaving pretty similar. 1974 would be 2023 and 1975 would be 2024.

📷

Why I think this is a good comparison? Well now we are talking about earnings this year, while the vast majorities of businesses haven’t even been really hit by demand slowdown. You can read it in all of their earnings presentations: “The company's margins have suffered as a consequence of increases in the cost of logistics and energy, BUT revenues are up”. Now the companies have raised their prices to get their margins back up. What do you think happens next? Demand starts slowing down and then shit hits the fan. In my opinion, the real damage to the businesses, the real demand drawdown is yet to come. 

People are losing their jobs now, but this is just the beginning. A lot of people have to renew their mortgages and that’s when its really going to hurt. And soon companies will start struggling with paying the high interest rates on their short-term debt and paying the higher wages people will want and that will not be possible for many companies. The bankruptcies and the renewing of the mortgages are what really gets the ball rollin’ and that hasn’t even begun yet. 

Also, some bond people like Steven van Metre are talking about dollar shortages and a few other problems in the banking system (also see Credit Suisse). I do not understand much of that, but what I do know is that bond people are smart and you should listen to them. If they say there are some more problems with the defaults on car loans or whatever, then there is something going on there.

Okay, so back to stagflation in todays environment: if you look at the MSCI World graph in 1973 and you assume the macroeconomic forces will play out similar in todays environment, then we will likely to have the bottom sometime mid 2023 – beginning of 2024. The stock market will then start rising again in 2024. Inevitably it will start rising sooner or later, I think we can agree on that. I know, I know, we live in different times, we have different companies today, etc. but lets just assume it plays out similar to 1973-74. 

Now the questions are: What to do until it bottoms? What to invest in? Where to park the money? 

3 years of 7,5% to 5% inflation means almost 20% less value in cash. That doesn’t sound that good, so maybe invest in some good companies? But what companies do good in such an environment.

For that I asked myself, what would I do, if I were to lose my job during this stagflation? (and let’s assume I have no emergency fund). I came up with this and tried to relate that to companies with products for which there will be demand:

1) Sell stuff that I don’t need in order to get cash, including my portfolio / my car

Second hand dealers might do well during stagflation

Cardealers might do well (at least at some point)

Brokers should make a lot of money in 2022-2023 during the sell-offs

2) Cut all expenses for stuff not needed

No more Amazon Prime? No more overrated insurances? 

3) Try to lend money somewhere else

Lending companies might do well

4) Search for a new job / search for a new home (move somewhere cheaper)

Job Portals might do well; real estate agents won’t profit because it was way more lucrative to sell new built home then to do rentals 

5) A lot of free time means: Watch Tv 

Broadcasting and Streamers might do well during stagflation 

6) What else? Well, I would still have to eat and drink. And this is maybe my key point around the stagflation period: I would still have to buy groceries and essentials (like toilet paper, hygiene products, cleaning products, coffee, etc.) as well as communication services, energy and transportation…These are items people can't do without. 

Would I buy more of these products? Most probably not. So, on the one hand these companies will most likely do better than the rest of the companies because demand will stay up, but on the other hand their valuation can still go down from their sky-high PEs. And still because of inflation and pricing power they would profit from higher revenues and maybe better margins. 

Some extra thoughts on point 6)

\- Are there any plays with higher revenues but not necessarily higher costs? Are there any products out there which do not depend on energy or higher wages?

\- Of course, the company has to produce free cash flow. (CASH is king, also check some recent Burry tweets [https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwe97z/\_/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwe97z/_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwewlw/\_/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/xwewlw/_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))

\- If a company has debt, especially termed out debt with a fixed yield, I consider this to be a good thing because they have already their yield secured and because they can buy back the bonds at a discount

\- Does anyone know where I can get data on which stocks performed well during 1973-1980?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR in a stagflation period buy companies which offer essential products and services which we need on the day to day basis, with pricing power, good free cash flow, termed out debt and are as least as possible depending on energy prices.

&amp;#x200B;

So, all of this being said, I have one final questions for you: What is YOUR stagflation bear market buy?

One possible answer, but not my favourite one, could be: Put the money in I-Bonds ([https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds))

Put $10K ($20K for married couples). Automatic 9.62% return for the next 6 months, followed by a 6.5% return for the following 6 months, amounting to around 8% return for the first year. You have to hold it there for a year. Minus 3 months interest if you withdraw before 5 years.

BigCommerce and Magento come nowhere close in usage and ease of setup.

1666039744,237," [WWE stock hits 52-week high in Vince McMahon scandal aftermath (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/17/wwe-stock-hits-52-week-high-mcmahon-scandal-aftermath.html) 

 

[World Wrestling Entertainment](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WWE/) is defying broader market trends this year.

The company’s stock is up more than 50% in 2022, hitting a 52-week high Monday, and trading at levels it hasn’t seen since summer 2019. The S&amp;P 500, by comparison, is down more than 20% this year.

The stock’s strong performance this year occurred as WWE’s live wrestling events business came roaring back after months of [Covid](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) restrictions and the company increasingly became the subject of sale talks. The stock continued to do well after WWE’s longtime leader and biggest shareholder, Vince McMahon, [retired from the company](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/vince-mcmahon-retires-as-chief-of-wwe-amid-probes-into-alleged-misconduct.html) over the summer in a cloud of scandal.

Shares of WWE were effectively flat Monday after hitting $76.90. The company’s market capitalization is more than $5.6 billion.

Industry insiders believe WWE could be [an acquisition target](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/07/formula-1-wwe-ufc-potential-acquisition-targets-for-streaming-services.html). A deal could come before the company’s next U.S. TV rights renewal — likely to be announced in mid-2023. WWE’s current U.S. streaming deal with NBCUniversal’s Peacock expires in 2026.

Analyst John Healy of Northcoast Research, who covers WWE, sees the stock’s success as a confluence of successful ratings, upcoming media deal opportunities and the speculation about a possible acquisition.

“That speculation has been going on for a long time, and I think will always be around this company given the unique asset that it is and the ownership structure,” Healy told CNBC on Monday.

He also noted that WWE is relatively insulated from consumer trends, saying that “two-thirds of the revenue is coming from locked-in relationships” with media companies. Given a highly saturated media market, Healy expects high bidding for the rights to “Raw” and “Smackdown,” which are set to be renegotiated in the coming year.

WWE has also had to deal with McMahon’s controversies. He retired in July after it was revealed that he had paid nearly $20 million in previously unrecorded expenses.

[Of those payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/17/vince-mcmahon-paid-5-million-to-donald-trumps-foundation-wwe-finds.html), almost $15 million went to settle sexual misconduct allegations from four women against McMahon over the last 16 years, and $5 million went to Donald Trump’s foundation from donations made in 2007 and 2009.

WWE has hinted that the hush money payments to alleged victims, already the subject of an ongoing independent review overseen by the company’s board, are under investigation by other entities.

Still, WWE stayed in the family. Stephanie McMahon, McMahon’s daughter, took over as chairwoman and co-CEO alongside Nick Khan, the company’s former president. Stephanie’s husband and longtime wrestler Paul “Triple H” Levesque has taken over as the company’s top creative executive, the role the elder McMahon had before he retired.

Vince McMahon, 77, remains the largest stakeholder in the company, holding about 32% of shares.","( ( defying broader market trends year. company’s stock 50% 2022, hitting 52-week high monday, trading levels hasn’t seen since summer 2019. sp 500, comparison, 20% year. stock’s strong performance year occurred wwe’s live wrestling events business came roaring back months ( restrictions company increasingly became subject sale talks. stock continued well wwe’s longtime leader biggest shareholder, vince mcmahon, ( summer cloud scandal. shares wwe effectively flat monday hitting $76.90. company’s market capitalization $5.6 billion. industry insiders believe wwe could ( deal could come company’s next u.s. tv rights renewal — likely announced mid-2023. wwe’s current u.s. streaming deal nbcuniversal’s peacock expires 2026. analyst john healy northcoast research, covers wwe, sees stock’s success confluence successful ratings, upcoming media deal opportunities speculation possible acquisition. “that speculation going long time, think always around company given unique asset ownership structure,” healy told cnbc monday. also noted wwe relatively insulated consumer trends, saying “two-thirds revenue coming locked-in relationships” media companies. given highly saturated media market, healy expects high bidding rights “raw” “smackdown,” set renegotiated coming year. wwe also deal mcmahon’s controversies. retired july revealed paid nearly $20 million previously unrecorded expenses.

1666060064,0,"A longtime pessimist about Tesla TSLA +7.01%  says the shares could be headed for what he calls “zombie stock” territory.

David Trainer, CEO of stock research firm New Constructs, who wrote in August 2013 that Tesla stock was “way overvalued” at $11 a share, said in a research note Monday that the shares have a long way to fall. The company’s spectacular sales growth could be the problem, he wrote.

Back in 2013, Trainer was worried about Tesla ’s low profitability, reliance on sales of zero-emission regulatory credits, and persistent cash burn. Tesla reported a small operating loss in 2013, but things have improved substantially.

The company is expected to report about $15 billion in operating profit for 2022. What’s more, Tesla has now generated positive free cash flow over its entire life and Wall Street projects another $6.5 billion during the second half of 2022. The total expected between 2023 and 2025 is roughly $55 billion.

Cheap growth capital and falling interest rates helped Tesla achieve those financial results. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury debt went from roughly 2.5% to 0.5% between mid-2013 and mid-2020, but interest rates are rising now. The 10-year Treasury yields almost 4%.

Rising rates are a new concern for Trainer. Higher interest rates tend to depress valuations for richly valued growth stocks the most. Growth companies, such as Tesla, generate most of their earnings and cash flow far in the future. Both are worth less in today’s dollars when discounted back at higher interest rates.

High valuations and rising rates help create the category of what Trainer refers to as “zombie stocks”—those that, roughly speaking, go nowhere, or fall, no matter what the underlying business produces. And Tesla is certainly highly valued, especially for a car company. Trainer notes that Tesla’s market capitalization at near $700 billion dwarfs the combined figure of nearly $400 billion for Toyota Motor (TM), General Motors (GM), Stellantis (STLA), Honda Motor (HMC), Tata Motors (TTM), and Nissan Motor (NSANY).

Growth, of course, is the reason for the gap. Tesla’s sales rose more than 110% between 2019 and 2021. Combined sales for the peer group dropped almost 10% over the same span.

Investors might think that growth would lift Tesla stock out of the zombie zone, but the reverse could be true. The larger Tesla’s car business gets, the more investors will treat the company like a car stock, giving it a valuation like those of other auto manufacturers, according to Trainer.

“If we assume Tesla sells 9% more vehicles than Toyota \[in 2031\] Tesla has 56%+ downside,” Trainer wrote. The logic is that for Tesla to get that big, its operating profit margins would have to fall to match those of its competitors. For Tesla, sales 9% higher than Toyota’s and comparable operating profit margins would yield roughly $44 billion in 2031 operating profit.

It’s a big number, but only 80% higher than what is now expected for 2023. According to Trainer’s financial model, that justifies a current share price of only $90 for Tesla stock, while the stock is comfortably above $200.

Concern over Tesla’s valuation isn’t new, and the stock remains controversial. Targets for the price on Wall Street range from about $24 to $530 a share. The so-called bull-bear spread of more than $500 is almost 250% of the recent stock price.

The bull-bear spread for GM stock is about 175%, while the figure for the industrial conglomerate 3M (MMM) is about 67%.

Trainer’s report didn’t hurt Tesla shares on Monday. The stock closed up 7%, at $219.35, while the S&amp;P 500SPX +2.65%  and Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA +1.86%  gained 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively.","longtime pessimist tesla tsla +7.01% says shares could headed calls “zombie stock” territory. david trainer, ceo stock research firm new constructs, wrote august 2013 tesla stock “way overvalued” $11 share, said research note monday shares long way fall. company’s spectacular sales growth could problem, wrote. back 2013, trainer worried tesla ’s low profitability, reliance sales zero-emission regulatory credits, persistent cash burn. tesla reported small operating loss 2013, things improved substantially. company expected report $15 billion operating profit 2022. what’s more, tesla generated positive free cash flow entire life wall street projects another $6.5 billion second half 2022. total expected 2023 2025 roughly $55 billion. cheap growth capital falling interest rates helped tesla achieve financial results. yield 10-year u.s. treasury debt went roughly 2.5% 0.5% mid-2013 mid-2020, interest rates rising now. 10-year treasury yields almost 4%. rising rates new concern trainer. higher interest rates tend depress valuations richly valued growth stocks most. growth companies, tesla, generate earnings cash flow far future. worth less today’s dollars discounted back higher interest rates. high valuations rising rates help create category trainer refers “zombie stocks”—those that, roughly speaking, go nowhere, fall, matter underlying business produces. tesla certainly highly valued, especially car company. trainer notes tesla’s market capitalization near $700 billion dwarfs combined figure nearly $400 billion toyota motor (tm), general motors (gm), stellantis (stla), honda motor (hmc), tata motors (ttm), nissan motor (nsany). growth, course, reason gap. tesla’s sales rose 110% 2019 2021. combined sales peer group dropped almost 10% span. investors might think growth would lift tesla stock zombie zone, reverse could true. larger tesla’s car business gets, investors treat company like car stock, giving valuation like auto manufacturers, according trainer. “if assume tesla sells 9% vehicles toyota \ tesla 56%+ downside,” trainer wrote. logic tesla get big, operating profit margins would fall match competitors. tesla, sales 9% higher toyota’s comparable operating profit margins would yield roughly $44 billion 2031 operating profit. it’s big number, 80% higher expected 2023. according trainer’s financial model, justifies current share price $90 tesla stock, stock comfortably $200. concern tesla’s valuation isn’t new, stock remains controversial. targets price wall street range $24 $530 share. so-called bull-bear spread $500 almost 250% recent stock price. bull-bear spread gm stock 175%, figure industrial conglomerate 3m (mmm) 67%. trainer’s report didn’t hurt tesla shares monday. stock closed 7%, $219.35, sp 500spx +2.65% dow jones industrial averagedjia +1.86% gained 2.7% 1.9%, respectively.","['Nissan Motor', 'GM', 'Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA +1.86%', 'Stellantis', 'General Motors', 'Honda Motor', 'New Constructs', 'Toyota Motor', 'U.S. Treasury', 'Tesla', 'Trainer', 'TM', 'TTM']"

1666114934,19,"Facebook META -0.11%▼ owner Meta Platforms Inc. META -0.25%▼ said it would sell its social-media animated-images company Giphy after the U.K.’s top competition authority affirmed an earlier order to undo the 2020 acquisition.

Facebook’s announcement all but ends a yearslong saga in which a foreign regulator made a rare intervention in an already-consummated deal between two American companies. British regulators had ordered Meta to operate Giphy separately while the deal was under review.

Meta, then known as Facebook, bought Giphy in May 2020 for $315 million. The company, with offices in New York City and Los Angeles, allows users to search for, create and share short animated videos, or GIFs, which have become popular in social-media posts, texts and other communications.

The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority initially ordered Meta to sell Giphy last year. Meta appealed the decision. In July, the Competition Appeal Tribunal backed the CMA in five out of six challenges to the CMA ruling. On Tuesday, after taking that ruling into consideration, the CMA issued a revised decision that again ordered Meta to sell Giphy.

Meta said it is disappointed by the order, but it won’t appeal the decision further. The company said it would work with the CMA to sell Giphy and is awaiting more details in the coming weeks from the regulator about how it should do so.

The decision comes as the CMA is asserting itself on the global stage as a technology regulator—opening antitrust cases against tech companies alongside others stemming from the U.S. and European Union. The CMA has open cases looking at issues including how Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG 0.91%▲ Google brokers ads on third-party websites, and the control that the regulator says Apple Inc. and Google exercise over mobile-phone software. The companies say they comply with competition rules and are working with the regulator.

Meta’s acquisition of Giphy “would significantly reduce competition in two markets,” said Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the investigative team appointed by the CMA to review the deal. By buying Giphy, Mr. McIntosh said Facebook had removed a “potential challenger in the U.K. display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media.” A sale of Giphy is the only way to address the issue, he said.

Meta had said in the past that consumers and Giphy are better off with the infrastructure and resources Meta can provide. The company said at the time of the deal that it would integrate Giphy into its Instagram platform.

The CMA began probing Meta’s Giphy deal soon after it was announced. Last fall, it fined Meta 50.5 million pounds, equivalent to $57.2 million, saying the company had failed to provide required updates outlining its compliance with the initial enforcement order in relation to the merger review. Meta at the time disputed the fine for what the company called a “best effort compliance approach.”

The move by the CMA isn’t an unprecedented one. In April 2020, it blocked Sabre Corp.’s tie-up with rival travel booking service Farelogix Inc., saying it was anticompetitive. The regulator said the deal could have reduced innovation in the sector and led to higher fees for certain products.

# [Stock futures give up earlier gains, turn negative despite Netflix’s strong results](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures gave up gains from earlier in the day Wednesday, even after the release of strong quarterly results from Netflix.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 121 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 0.5% each.
*****
&gt; Netflix shares rallied 13% after the streaming giant posted earnings and revenue that beat estimates as well as strong subscriber growth for the third quarter. Other tech-related names such as Meta, Amazon and Microsoft traded higher in the premarket.
*****
&gt; United Airlines, Intuitive Surgical and Procter &amp; Gamble were among the other names rising in premarket trading after strong quarterly reports.
*****
&gt; The solid start to earnings season comes as many on Wall Street have been resetting their earnings projections lower and investors are worried about a recession. Even though equities have rallied in the first two days of the week, Treasury yields remain high and were climbing on Wednesday, suggesting that recession fears are still intact.
*****
&gt; “On the plus side, corporate earnings season may help investor confidence somewhat, just given current oversold conditions and reduced expectations. That should help equities keep their footing, but until we see 2-year and 10-year yields start to decline we think traders and investors should remain wary of expecting too much from this rally,” said Nick Colas of DataTrek Research.
*****
&gt; Tech earnings will be in full swing next week, but IBM and Tesla are on deck to report Wednesday. Social media firm Snap will report later in the week.
*****
&gt; In economic data, investors are looking forward to housing starts on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve’s so-called Beige Book, the central bank’s report on the current state of economic conditions, will come out as well.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves came after another strong day for stocks, with the Dow rallying about 337 points Tuesday and the S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.1%.

The entrepreneur has just broken his silence with a warning about the health of the economy, which will reinforce fears that a recession is inevitable. 

Because of its central place in e-commerce, Amazon is one of the reliable barometers of the health of public consumption, which in turn is a key engine of American economic growth.

""Yep, the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches,"" Bezos posted on Twitter on Oct. 18.

In other words, he says people must prepare for a crisis that seems on the horizon. 

 

## Comment Regarding Goldman CEO Solomon

 The billionaire commented on a short video interview with David Solomon, the CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs  (**GS**) - Get Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (The) Report, on CNBC, which was broadcast the same day. In the clip Solomon says that there is a big chance that the economy will enter a recession.

""I think it's a time to be cautious,"" Solomon said. ""And I think that if you're running a risk-based business, it's a time to think more cautiously about your risk box, your risk appetite. I think you have to expect that there's more volatility on the horizon.""

The banker added: ""Now, that doesn't mean for sure that we have a really difficult economic scenario, but in the distribution of outcomes, there's good chance we could have a recession.""

The economy's health is currently a subject of concern to markets, households and politicians alike, particularly as the U.S. midterm elections are just weeks away.

Many economists blame the Federal Reserve's monetary policy as one of the causes of the current downturn. The central bank was initially slow to raise its interest rates, thus allowing the prices of goods and products to rise, they say.

When the Fed subsequently pivoted by raising rates, it did so aggressively, in an attempt to crush inflation, which today is at a 40-year high. The problem, the same economists have warned, is that this effort will cause a so-called hard landing in the economy, a recession. 

In addition to Solomon, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase,  (**JPM**) - Get JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Report said on Oct. 10 that the economy would enter a recession ""six to nine months from now.”

More than two-thirds (69%) of Americans are worried about the possibility of a recession by the end of 2023, according to a July survey by personal finance website Bankrate.com.","short. stocks go go down.

1666254030,159,"Six and twelve months ago I made posts breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/)) to determine whether it's really as expensive as people say, or as cheap as Tesla bulls claim.

After yesterday's earnings report, my analyses continue to seem fairly accurate, and I thought it would be worth updating the numbers to see if anything's changed.

For those who don't like reading, you can skip straight to ""The Numbers"". For everyone else, I will first explain again how I got to my numbers.

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth into the future to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might change slightly today, let's use their pre-earnings market cap of roughly $700B to determine if Tesla really is over- or undervalued.

For this post, I have also added the PEG rating, as this can give us a bit more insight into the valuation of a growth stock like Tesla.

------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my first analysis. After Q3 2022, that has grown to $74,863, with Q3 2022 being a 55% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, that has grown to 17.2%.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,499M after Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, this has grown to $11,190M, with Q3 2022 being a 103% YoY increased.

------------------------------

**The future**

Last time, I said the following:

&gt; We have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.

Following Q3, this was slightly disappointing at 17.2%. Lower than Q1 despite higher deliveries, in part due to lower deliveries compared to production as Tesla is shifting away from end-of-quarter delivery pushes (20K cars were on a boat at the end of the quarter that previously would've been sold before quarter end). That said, it's still up 18% or 2600 basis points YoY, easily industry leading for high volume automakers (BMW is second at 14.5%), and Tesla guided for record high margins in Q4.

I also said:

&gt; While we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.

Since then, we have heard rumours that Berlin is expected to reach at least comparable margins to Shanghai, despite significantly higher wages. While this still remains uncertain, it would certainly reinforce their bullish sentiment on margins quoted above.

Then I said:

&gt; I think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.

&gt; That said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.

Since then, it appears that Texas and Berlin are not ramping faster than Shanghai did. 400K this year is looking entirely impossible, with ~100K being more likely.

That said, Shanghai has continued to ramp beyond expectation and is now at a 1.2M unit run rate. Peak production so far has been 57K Model Ys in August and 30K Model 3s in September, which would put the factory's maximum real output (remember factories can never reach their full run rate due to holidays and other downtime) at over 1M vehicles per year (highest volume car factory in the world by about 20%) or 250K per quarter. Well above even Q1's 170K.

------------------------------

**The numbers**

Updating the expected numbers from my previous posts (you can go back to them to compare what has changed if you like) based on the latest information, my Bear and Bull case numbers are as follows:

**Sales**

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|1,350,000|1,500,000|
|**2023**|2,000,000|2,600,000|
|**2024**|2,600,000|3,700,000|

**ASP**

Last time, ASPs increased significantly, from $50,000 to ~$57,500. In Q3 2022, they decreased slightly to $54,350. I expect these prices to start to increase again with the upcoming tax incentives, as Tesla mentioned they expect to take the full tax incentive from the Inflation Induction Act for vehicles, battery production and battery sourcing for a total of $10K+ per car. I expect this will offset the reduced demand from the recession and further increase ASPs to ~$57,5K in 2023 and then remain stable while Tesla continues to drive down costs.


**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs ($54K for 2022, $57,5K for 2023 and 2024) and delivery numbers, the revenues would be:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$73B|$81B|
|**2023**|$115B|$150B|
|**2024**|$150B|$213B|

**Operating Margin**

A year ago I said:

&gt; Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.

This is where I was most wrong after Q1. Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. Since then, operating margin has decreased to 17.2%, with an expected record operating margin in Q4. This makes me slightly less confident about their steep increase in margins, so I will be adjusting those slightly to the downside.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|17%|19%|
|**2023**|19%|23%|
|**2024**|21%|27%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$12.4B|$15.4B|
|**2023**|$21.9B|$34.5B|
|**2024**|$31.5B|$57.5B|

**P/E**

Dividing our $700B market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|56|45|
|**2023**|32|20|
|**2024**|22|12|

**PEG**

Since PE ratios are pretty useless by themselves, I've added a PEG rating this time. Large caps traditionally tend to float at PEG ratios between 1.5 and 3.5. That said, extreme growth companies like Tesla tend to have slightly lower PEG ratios, as investors assume the growth will come down more rapidly over time. So perhaps a PEG between 1 and 2 is more reasonable.

Also worth to note is that only 1.6% of companies in the S&amp;P have a PEG of below 0.5, and 0.2 is the lowest PEG rating in the entire S&amp;P. As a general rule of thumb though, anything below a PEG of 1 is typically considered undervalued.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|0.45|0.25|
|**2023**|0.42|0.16|
|**2024**|0.50|0.18|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

After Q3 2022 and using the $700B market cap, I expect Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 12 and 22 by the end of 2024. With a growth rate between 44% and 67% respectively, Tesla would have a PEG rating of between 0.50 and 0.18. To get to normal PEG levels, that means Tesla stock would have to grow between 100% and 1,011% from here through Q1 2025.

Interesting to note is how Tesla only needs to double earnings to have a lower PE ratio than the S&amp;P average, when high growth companies tend to have much higher PEs than the average; I'm expecting Tesla to almost 3x their earnings in just 3 years in the bear case.

Also worth mentioning is how, even in the bear case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($22B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the bull case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.

So to conclude, the popular sentiment that ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" is entirely false.

**Important side note**

For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business (including their automotive software sales), as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid ""FSD doesn't exist"", ""energy is a scam"" and ""the Bot will never be useful"" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.

# [Dow futures rise slightly as investors digest corporate earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were mixed on Thursday as traders weighed several key earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 93 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked up 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Several strong earnings reports were boosting the market, with AT&amp;T, American Airlines and IBM all moving higher in premarket trading after beating estimates on the top and bottom lines for their most recent quarter.
*****
&gt; On the downside, Tesla shares dropped 4% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker said Wednesday evening it expects to miss its 2022 deliveries target. The company also posted a quarterly revenue that missed analyst expectations.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 4.18% on Thursday, briefly trading at levels not seen since 2008. It was last flat for the session near 4.13%. Rising rates have been a headwind for stocks all year, as the Federal Reserve continues to try and cool off inflationary pressures not seen in decades.
*****
&gt; The surge in yields on Thursday contributed to the end of a two-day winning streak for stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite sliding 0.85%. The Dow declined 99.99 points, or 0.33%, and the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.67%.
*****
&gt; “Despite recent market volatility, central bank tightening expectations have only increased as inflation
readings around the world have continued to come in hot. While there are bound to be more big up &amp;
down days ahead, our intermediate-term bearish base case remains unchanged,” Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey and the weekly jobless claims data are expected Thursday before the bell.

1666326057,15,"* **The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators index indicated that conditions worsened in September.**
* **While not usually considered a major data point, the LEI, combined with Fed rate hikes, is signaling trouble for the economy.**
* **“We went from a Fed that was way too easy to being irresponsibly tight,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Capital Markets.**

&amp;#x200B;

The economy sent a low-key signal Thursday that a recession is looming — and that the Federal Reserve could be making a policy mistake by continuing to try to slow things down.

According to the Conference Board’s [Leading Economic Indicators](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators) index, conditions worsened in September, with the gauge down 0.4% from the month before and off 2.8% for the six-month period.

“The US LEI fell again in September and its persistent downward trajectory in recent months suggests a recession is increasingly likely before year end,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economics at the Conference Board. Ozyildrim noted that the weakness in the index was “widespread” as high inflation, a decelerating jobs picture and tighter credit conditions are pressuring the economy.

The index looks forward using 10 metrics that include manufacturing hours worked, jobless claims, building permits, stock market indexes and credit spreads.

Normally, the LEI is not considered a major data point. It’s not necessarily that the measure isn’t a good snapshot of the economy, but more that the data points that go into the index are already known, so there’s not much new information.

## A reverse trend for the Fed

However, in the present conditions, the index is of greater significance as it comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is looking to tighten the screws further on growth in an effort to bring down rampant inflation.

That bucks a general historical trend where the Fed is usually loosening policy when the outlook turns darker. However, Fed officials are stressing that they’re far from finished when it comes to raising rates.

“We went from a Fed that was way too easy to being irresponsibly tight,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Capital Markets and a former senior economic advisor to then-President Donald Trump. “When this basket is signaling the weakness that it’s showing, what the Fed typically does is not raise rates. But in this case, it’s not only raising rates aggressively, but with a commitment to continue raising rates aggressively.”

LaVorgna’s research shows that in previous downturns in the leading indicators, the Fed was always cutting rates or in pause at the same time. This was the case in early 2020, the financial crisis in 2008 and the recession in the early part of the 21st century — among multiple other economic contractions.

He is concerned that the Fed’s insistence on tightening policy will have even worse outcomes ahead.

“The lags in the policy mean the full effects of Fed actions have not yet been wholly felt. Worryingly, the Fed is not done,” LaVorgna said in a client note.

LaVorgna is not alone in his belief that the Fed is overdoing its efforts to tamp down inflation that continues to run around its highest levels since the early 1980s.

In a [recent CNBC interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/barry-sternlicht-says-unbelievable-calamities-ahead-if-the-fed-keeps-hiking-.html?&amp;amp;qsearchterm=sternlicht%20fed), Starwood Capital Group CEO Barry Sternlicht said the central bank is risking “unbelievable calamities if they keep up their action, and not just here, all over the globe.” [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) CEO David Solomon, [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/) and Amazon founder [Jeff Bezos](https://www.cnbc.com/jeff-bezos/) in recent days [all have expressed concern](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-warns-its-time-to-batten-down-the-hatches.html) about a recession ahead, though they have not singled out the Fed’s actions.

## Disappointment on inflation

However, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Thursday he thinks [the central bank still has work to do](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/20/feds-harker-sees-lack-of-progress-on-inflation-expects-aggressive-rate-hikes-ahead.html) before it can relax as he said he’s seen a “disappointing lack of progress” in the inflation fight.

“What we really need to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening monetary policy,” said the central bank official, who is a nonvoting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

Thus far, the inflation data indeed has not been on the Fed’s side.

In addition to the typical headline metrics such as the consumer price index and the Fed’s preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, the Cleveland Fed’s [“sticky price” CPI](https://www.atlantafed.org/research/inflationproject/stickyprice) rose 8.5% on an annualized basis in September, up from 7.7% in August. The measure looks at items such as rent, the price of food away from home and recreation costs.

Services inflation has been particularly nagging, rising 7.4% in September on a 12-month basis, up from 6.8% in August, according to Trading Economics. That has happened as the economy has transitioned back to services from high goods demand for much of the Covid era.

Critics, though, say the Fed is following too many backward-looking data points. But policymakers also are fighting a battle against inflation expectations that, [while drifting lower now](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/consumer-inflation-and-spending-expectations-show-sharp-decline-.html), could turn higher especially now that gasoline prices are rising again.

“The challenge for the Fed is we haven’t seen the true leading indicators be leading in the sense that inflation has still stayed persistently elevated in the face of these leading indicators that would suggest otherwise,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial.

In Roach’s view, the only bright spot is that financial markets could be close to pricing in all of the damage from higher rates and inflation. Also, the continued decline in the LEI at least could give the Fed reason to slow the pace of its rate hikes. Roach expects the Fed to hike by another 0.75 percentage point in November, then decelerate to a 0.5-point move in December, which is not the market expectation.

“In a nutshell, this report does not likely change anything for the November meeting,” Roach said. “However, you could argue that this does build a case for a downshift in December.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When Snap Inc. went public in 2017, this column boiled down the entire investment opportunity to one, simple question: [Do you trust Evan Spiegel?](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investing-in-snap-ipo-is-an-impotent-bet-on-unproven-executives-2017-02-23?mod=article_inline)  
&gt;  
&gt;As Snap [**SNAP,** **-0.64%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/SNAP?mod=MW_story_quote) stock heads toward its lowest prices since March 2020, and potentially even lower, that question is even more important, and answering “yes” should be even harder.  
&gt;  
&gt;Three months ago, amid the beginning of a huge slowdown in the ad business, [Snap initiated a unique dividend meant to ensure that the founders maintained control ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-snap-melts-down-its-founders-make-sure-to-protect-the-people-who-matter-themselves-11658452231?mod=article_inline)of the company, even if they sold their stock — protecting themselves. [Then in August, news came that Snap was laying off](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/snap-plans-to-lay-off-roughly-one-in-every-five-employees-according-to-report-11661890384?mod=article_inline) one in five employees. As Snap again reported disappointing results Thursday and saw the stock plunge again, the company decided now was the time to initiate a stock buyback plan, promising to spend up to $500 million to offset the dilution from employee stock plans — in the past nine months, Snap has spent $937 million on stock-based compensation.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the face of it, this seems like an investor-friendly approach — Barron’s pointed out earlier this year that i[nvestors were suffering while employees were faring better with the hefty stock-comp plans](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/snap-stock-ipo-grants-51653411013?mod=mw_quote_news_seemore&amp;mod=article_inline). But it’s also worth pointing out who the biggest investors in Snap are: Spiegel and his co-founder Bobby Murphy.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the company’s largest individual shareholders, Spiegel and Murphy are among the key beneficiaries of Snap’s plans to buy back stock, which usually leads to a boost in the stock price. Those two still control over 99% of the voting power of the company’s capital stock, and as the parent of Snapchat reminded investors in its annual report, “Mr. Spiegel alone can exercise voting control over a majority of our outstanding capital stock.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Shares of[ Snap tumbled an additional 25% to just under $8 in after-hours trading](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/snap-stock-plunges-25-as-advertising-slows-down-executives-decline-to-offer-forecast-11658435618?mod=article_inline), putting them near the lowest prices since March 2020. On Thursday, the company ended regular trading hours with a market capitalization of around $17.91 billion, but that was headed toward $13 billion with the after-hours collapse.  
&gt;  
&gt;Besides protecting themselves and their investment, Snap’s executives have shown little ability to head off big issues, nor offer any worthwhile solutions to the current ad downturn. In the third quarter, its revenue grew a paltry 6%, down from the most recent second-quarter revenue growth of 13%. Snap appears to be in a steady revenue slowdown, from its peak growth of 116% in the June 2021 quarter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Snap has blamed both privacy changes that Apple Inc. [**AAPL,** **-0.33%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote) made to the iPhone that affected ad tracking, and more recently, the macroeconomic advertising climate, while avoiding one of the biggest factors — the rise of TikTok. Top executives didn’t seem to see any of those challenges coming early enough, and did not do enough about them once they did.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The company was slow to react — or acknowledge — the significant headwinds faced by privacy initiatives, compounded by competition, and more recently macro headwinds,” Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird Equity Research, wrote in a note.  
&gt;  
&gt;The competition factor, mostly from China’s TikTok, was addressed briefly on the company’s call with analysts, but was not really acknowledged by Snap leaders.","( #x200b; &gt;when snap inc. went public 2017, column boiled entire investment opportunity one, simple question: ( &gt; &gt;as snap ( stock heads toward lowest prices since march 2020, potentially even lower, question even important, answering “yes” even harder. &gt; &gt;three months ago, amid beginning huge slowdown ad business, ( company, even sold stock — protecting themselves.

1666368988,223,"An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?

The answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]

This post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.

**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**

[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

From another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):

&gt; As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000® Index) led both large caps (S&amp;P 500®) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap®) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.


But even outside of recessions, the outperformance is [robust across many decades](https://i.imgur.com/W0sAt4K.png), though. [Another graph](https://i.imgur.com/0OaFiH1.png),  and [another](https://i.imgur.com/HBkJ6aA.png).

**Why target cheaper stocks (value, not growth) ?**

 Here are the excess returns (annualized over 1964-2017) of small cap stocks sorted by the cheapness: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/f4lHHSk.png). The cheapest stocks are on the left. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

This has been validated in the literature, for example by the AQR paper [""Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk""](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Size-Matters-If-You-Control-Your-Junk). Essentially, small cap stocks contain a lot of 'junk,' especially among the small cap growth class. [Note: By growth, we use the academic definition of high price / (book value).]

Thus, I would not recommend targeting small cap growth in particular. Growth really just means expensive, and what the data shows is targeting cheaper stocks (value) and applying quality filters like profitability requirements yields better returns.

**Why target small cap value now or in the near future?**

- US small cap value is relatively insulated from the broader global economy, unlike the enormous multinational firms dominating the S&amp;P 500. They do not face the currency risks that are currently hitting large cap company's revenues. [Source](https://www.federatedinvestors.com/insights/article/why-small-cap-value-now.do) and [source](https://www.royceinvest.com/insights/small-cap-interview).
- Right now, the problem in the US economy is its strong labor market. Small cap value stocks see more earnings growth (relative to large firms) in such periods.

&gt; Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.

&gt; 
&gt; While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks — Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks — the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.

Goldman Sachs analyst:

&gt;  Meanwhile, small cap stocks trade at much more attractive valuation levels than large-caps, according to the note. The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 trades at a P/E multiple of 11x, which is near its cheapest level of the last 30 years. ""This multiple also represents a 30% discount to the S&amp;P 500,"" Kostin said.  That's the largest discount since the dot-com bubble, and if earnings don't deteriorate meaningfully from here, it could represent a big opportunity for investors.

**Cheapness is even more pronounced in Europe**


&gt; Arnold also writes “value stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they’ve actually de-rated over the last five years.”

&gt; On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: “The Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!”
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, Arnold writes that “over the last five years Europe’s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!”

**It's a good hedge if there is a decade stagnation of the broader markets**

&gt;  After Japan's bubble burst, from 1990 to 2019, Japanese total country returns averaged 0.6%. Japanese small cap value averaged 5.13% and Japanese value stocks averaged 4%. During 2000-2010,  US small cap value grew 7.94% on average and US value stocks grew 4.56% on average, in contrast to a declining/flat S&amp;P 500.

You aren't just tilting a riskier asset class, you're tilting something that is less correlated to the broader market than your typical stock holdings. Hedge yourselves against a lost decade with this asset class.

**But why add if VTI already has small cap value inside it?**

Because market weights aren't gospel, and just as someone with less risk tolerance adds bonds, someone with more can add small cap value. VTI places 3% of its allocation into the SCV category. How about make it 10%?

**Ticker recommendations**:

I use AVUV/AVDV personally for US small cap value and ex-US developed small cap value. Some people also use VIOV or VBR. You could of course pick your own stocks, but the risk is definitely amplified.

I explain [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrwvxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/iqjujjw/) how Avantis (who created AVUV and AVDV) approach their ETFs. They already use quality filters to make sure you avoid junk while still getting a diversified exposure. 

&gt; They look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies ""tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning

The Commerce Department releases its report on August sales of new homes in the U.S. New-home sales fell 12.6% in July compared with June.

The Conference Board publishes its September consumer-confidence index, which measures U.S. attitudes toward jobs and the economy. Consumer confidence improved in August after falling for three consecutive months.

Wednesday

The National Association of Realtors reports the number of home sales based on contract signings in August. Pending home sales declined in July for the second consecutive month as high mortgage rates and elevated home prices diminished demand.

Thursday

The Commerce Department publishes a third estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product—a broad measure of the goods and services produced in an economy—after its second estimate showed that the decline in U.S. economic output during that time was less severe than initially estimated. The second estimate showed that the economy contracted at a 0.6% annual rate in the April-through-June period, a slower pace than the 0.9% decline initially estimated, driven in part by an upward revision of consumer spending.

China’s National Bureau of Statistics and S&amp;P Global release September surveys of purchasing managers about economic activity in China’s manufacturing sector. China’s agency also releases a separate survey measuring the country’s nonmanufacturing sector.  

Friday

* **Up to half of the Elon Musk-run EV maker's profitability comes from China sales, the bank said.**
* **Tesla and Chinese tech stocks have both fallen sharply this year as recession fears intensify**

**Tesla rakes in so much of its profits from Chinese sales that it will behave like a tech stock listed on Hong Kong's Hang Seng or the Shanghai Composite index until at least 2030**, according to Morgan Stanley.

The electric carmaker is likely to find itself closely tethered to the price movements of China's tech stocks because up to half of its profits come from that country, its analysts said in a Monday research note.

""**We estimate Tesla generates as much as one-half of its profitability from the Chinese market, arguably making the stock a derivative of a Chinese tech stock,**"" the team led by equity analyst Adam Jonas said.

Tesla's reliance on sales to China makes it vulnerable to a rise in geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, Morgan Stanley said.

Recently, Musk was praised by Chinese government officials for suggesting that Taiwan — a flashpoint in tensions with the US — should become a special administrative zone like Hong Kong.

Tesla will likely be reliant on its sales in China until at least 2030, the Morgan Stanley team said. That leaves it exposed, if the hostilities between the US and China intensify.

""The broader arc of Sino-US economic relations and the evolving geopolitical situation will continue to add volatility to Tesla shares,"" the bank said.

""Our forecasts through 2030 become gradually less China-dependent, but this takes time.""

# [Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures slip as investors await big tech earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Tuesday as investors looked ahead to big technology earnings for further clues into the health of the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 115 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Amazon slipped slightly in premarket trading on reports of a hiring freeze, while Discover Financial shed more than 1% on disappointing earnings results.
*****
&gt; Tuesday’s moves came after another strong day for stocks.
*****
&gt; The Dow rose 417.06 points, or 1.3%, on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite finished 0.9% higher and the S&amp;P 500 added roughly 1.2%, with nine of 11 sectors finishing higher, led by health care.
*****
&gt; “The market has become accustomed to the real price volatility, almost desensitized to it,” said Jeff O’Connor, head of market structure in the Americas for Liquidnet. “And the wild moves are making trading conditions that much more difficult.”
*****
&gt; Investors this week remain laser-focused on earnings from the biggest technology companies, with reports from Alphabet and Microsoft due Tuesday. Meta Platforms reports Wednesday, followed by Amazon and Apple on Thursday. Given their sheer size and market capitalization, any moves are likely to drive the market going forward.
*****
&gt; So far this season, companies have proven they may be faring better than anticipated. That’s due in part to the fact that analysts’ earnings estimates have come down in recent months as companies faced foreign exchange headwinds and other growth concerns. This could set up stocks for rallies on potentially better-than-feared outcomes.
*****
&gt; ″’Earnings really have come down quite a bit,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “Maybe investors are happy because it’s up 2% and not down 2% but we’ve also been seeing reductions in 2023 forecasts. This bear market probably has to play itself out even if we do get a near-term bear market rally.”
*****
&gt; UPS, GE, Coca-Cola all reported earnings before the bell Tuesday. Chipotle Mexican Grill and Texas Instruments will report after the Tuesday close.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, S&amp;P/Case-Shiller August home prices, FHFA August home prices and October consumer confidence are slated for release Tuesday.

1666704263,17,"* **Elon Musk has until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to close his deal with Twitter or a trial date will be set.**
* **Experts say the deal is expected to close. If not, Musk could face an uphill battle in court.**
* **If Musk becomes Twitter's new owner, Twitter will undergo a chapter of major change and likely layoffs.**
* **Musk will have to pay $32 billion to close the deal (excluding loans) - likely to sell anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion in Tesla stock to help finance the deal**

The billionaire has only four days to close his deal with Twitter or face a trial — **which experts say he is** **likely to lose.**

Earlier this month, the Delaware judge overseeing the court case gave the two parties **until 5 p.m. ET on** **Friday,** **October 28** **to agree to a new deal or the case will resume in a five-day trial in November.**

Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick is unlikely to offer an extension and would favor a quick start for the trial if Musk misses the deadline, University of Michigan business law professor Erik Gordon told Insider.

Ann Lipton, a business law professor at Tulane University Law School, told Insider that, **""unless there's truly some new, intervening event that was entirely out of Musk's control that derails the deal, he'll probably have exhausted the court's supply of goodwill.""**

Anat Alon-Beck, assistant professor of law at Case Western Reserve University, said Musk would likely end up buying the company even if he can't complete the acquisition ahead of the deadline — **after paying** **millions more in legal fees.**

**But, experts say Musk is likely to reach a deal before the deadline expires on Friday.**

Things would get worse for Musk if he heads to court

If the two parties don't reach an agreement before Friday, they could technically continue to negotiate even as litigation resumes and a trial date is scheduled.

But a continued court battle is unlikely to do Musk any favors.

**""He knows that he has no way out of it and would like to avoid public humiliation,""** Alon-Beck told Insider.

**If the trial were to proceed, Musk would face a** **lengthy deposition** **and could see even more of his** **private texts** **released to the public**, Gerard Filitti, senior counsel at The Lawfare Project, an international non-profit legal think tank and litigation fund based in New York City, [previously told Insider.](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loser-in-twitter-takeover-lawyers-win-2022-10)

**Last week,** **Bloomberg reported** **that Twitter and Musk are drawing up paperwork to close the deal ahead of the Friday deadline, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.** When Musk initially filed to end the court case and buy the company at the original price, Twitter appeared wary of the billionaire's intentions. The company has said it will not close the deal until Musk can prove he has funding in place.

Musk's original financing package for Twitter included **$21 billion in cash and $12.5 billion of margin loans secured against his 16% stake in Tesla, as well as $13 billion in loans from several banks**. But, Insider's Kali Hay reported that at least one investor was looking to pull out of the deal.

The banks, including Morgan Stanley, are finalizing funding, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. **The billionaire is still on the hook for another $32 billion, but is likely to sell anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion in Tesla stock to help finance the deal**, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in a note on Friday.

If Musk goes through with the deal this week, it's still possible the saga could continue even after an agreement is reached.

1666704267,292,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/apple-tightens-its-rules-on-crypto-and-nfts-in-its-app-store.html

Apple clarified its rules on cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) laying out what apps are allowed to do with these technologies. On crypto exchanges, Apple said in updated App Store rules on Monday, that apps may facilitate “transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange.” But the app can only be offered in countries or regions where it has licensing and permission to operate a crypto exchange. “Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality,” such as cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency wallets. Apple has clarified the rules on NFTs, which can be a digital representation of a real-life asset such as artwork and are usually purchased using cryptocurrency. The guidelines say apps may use in-app purchases to sell NFTs and sell services related to them, such as minting, listing, and the transferring of these tokens. Apps can also allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others so long as the apps do “not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.”

All of this means that any sort of trading service for NFTs must use Apple’s in-app payment mechanism. Apple takes an up to 30% cut of in-app payments. While this does not ban NFTs in any way, it does put a major restriction on the kind of services that can be offered involving NFTs, given the 30% slice Apple takes. Apple’s 30% cut has long been criticized by app makers who accuse the technology giant of running a monopoly over in-app purchases. Apple argues that control over the App Store allows it to ensure the security of apps and payments. It has also said that the App Store has birthed a successful app ecosystem allowing developers to make money.","apple clarified rules cryptocurrencies non-fungible tokens (nfts) laying apps allowed technologies. crypto exchanges, apple said updated app store rules monday, apps may facilitate “transactions transmissions cryptocurrency approved exchange.” app offered countries regions licensing permission operate crypto exchange. “apps may use mechanisms unlock content functionality,” cryptocurrencies cryptocurrency wallets. apple clarified rules nfts, digital representation real-life asset artwork usually purchased using cryptocurrency. guidelines say apps may use in-app purchases sell nfts sell services related them, minting, listing, transferring tokens. apps also allow users browse nft collections owned others long apps “not include buttons, external links, calls action direct customers purchasing mechanisms in-app purchase.” means sort trading service nfts must use apple’s in-app payment mechanism. apple takes 30% cut in-app payments. ban nfts way, put major restriction kind services offered involving nfts, given 30% slice apple takes. apple’s 30% cut long criticized app makers accuse technology giant running monopoly in-app purchases. apple argues control app store allows ensure security apps payments. also said app store birthed successful app ecosystem allowing developers make money.","['Apple', 'NFT']"
1666710290,244,"Corning stock fell over 4% on Tuesday morning after the company reported a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter, blaming slow smartphone glass sales. Corning makes a variety of different components and supplies many of the top electronics companies, like Samsung and Apple, which reports earnings this week amid concern over slowing consumer electronics sales. But there is optimism that slowing electronics sales won’t hurt the high-end of the market as much as less expensive devices. Corning said it expected $3.55 billion in core, or adjusted, sales for the fourth quarter, short of a FactSet analyst consensus of $3.75 billion.

The company said that it would wait to see positive signs before telling investors about future recovery in the business. In the quarter ending in September, Corning saw smartphone unit sales decline 14% on an annual basis, and tablet and notebook demand fall 17%, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said on an earnings call. He added that annual automotive production is also behind its previously expected pace. “So now the question is, when will the glass market recover?” asked Weeks. “My answer is we would like to see additional positive evidence before we guide a robust recovery in glass demand.”

And the consumer electronics slowdown doesn’t seem to be getting better this year, Weeks said. “We now expect smartphones to be down about 12% for the year, and we expect notebook and tablet demand to decline 15%,” Weeks said. “We expect the year-over-year decline in smartphones, notebooks and tablets to be greater in the second half than in the first half.”

Also 2  Apple suppliers in China that rely on the parts and assemble them into larger modules are also cutting their production 70% and 90% respectively

1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.

2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don’t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they’re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.

3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. 

I feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney.

1666801602,39,"Because INTC is keeping 50% of all Mobileye shares long term, that means they will keep 400 million shares  for their shareholders (~800m total shares, although for now they still own 95% - they may eventually offload the 45% if the value and demand is there).

 there are 4 billion INTC shares, so **each share is basically assigned 0.1 mobileye share, or every 10 intel shares includes 1 full mobileye share.**

So INTC share price is really discounted by 10% of a mobileye share. eg Mobileye at $28 means that an INTC share is worth $2.8 of mobileye value, so at the current price of $27.5, the MBLY part is $2.8 and the INTC part is $24.7 (MBLY at current cheap prices is worth 11.33% of an INTC share price).

Once you factor in  the dividend for the INTC part only because MBLY doesnt pay a dividend, it gets even better. Its great the market can now assign some value to INTC assets instead of ignoring them, or guessing random amounts. If MBLY increases it might reach over 25% of each INTC share dollar weighting at some point.

Lastly a large increase in MBLY will bring in lots of capital to INTC when they sell another 45% of the company, which they will only do if the price shoots up and has large demand. 

Maybe even Elon will secretly buy some as TSLA self driving is more like human driving with some aids and hes slowed down on making false promises to his shareholders about it recently.","intc keeping 50% mobileye shares long term, means keep 400 million shares shareholders (~800m total shares, although still 95% - may eventually offload 45% value demand there). 4 billion intc shares, **each share basically assigned 0.1 mobileye share, every 10 intel shares includes 1 full mobileye share.** intc share price really discounted 10% mobileye share. eg mobileye $28 means intc share worth $2.8 mobileye value, current price $27.5, mbly part $2.8 intc part $24.7 (mbly current cheap prices worth 11.33% intc share price). factor dividend intc part mbly doesnt pay dividend, gets even better. great market assign value intc assets instead ignoring them, guessing random amounts. mbly increases might reach 25% intc share dollar weighting point. lastly large increase mbly bring lots capital intc sell another 45% company, price shoots large demand. maybe even elon secretly buy tsla self driving like human driving aids hes slowed making false promises shareholders recently.","['Tesla', 'T-Mobile US', 'Intel', 'MBLY']"

Facebook’s parent is contending with a broad slowdown in online ad spending, challenges from [Apple’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) iOS privacy update and increased competition from TikTok. Add it up, and Meta is expected to post its second straight quarter of [declining sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html).

Although Meta is investing heavily in its Reels short-video service to steer users away from TikTok, the product is in the early days of generating revenue and isn’t as lucrative as Facebook’s core features, like Stories and the newsfeed.

Meta is trying to make Reels more attractive to advertisers and has announced new ad formats intended to give businesses enhanced options for promoting their products through short videos. The company also recently [debuted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/facebook-is-selling-ads-in-new-places-on-instagram-and-whatsapp-.html) new ways for companies to advertise on Instagram and Messenger, padding its overall ad inventory, which could potentially bolster overall sales.

Still, the stock is down 62% for the year, more than double the drop in the Nasdaq, and analysts are skeptical of the company’s prospects through this year and into 2023.

Bank of America recently downgraded Meta from buy to neutral and said in a research [note](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/bank-of-america-downgrades-meta-says-lower-ad-spending-could-hurt-reels.html) that “we expect advertiser budget cuts in early 2023 to weigh on sentiment and drive added uncertainty” following the Apple update and the “Reels transition.” The firm said it expects 4% growth in 2023, below Wall Street estimates of 9%, and sees “some downside risk to our estimates in a recession.”

Investors will also be focused on Meta’s user numbers, which have stagnated. Most concerning are the user figures in the U.S. and Canada, its biggest region for revenue.  

In the second quarter of 2022, Meta counted 197 million daily active users in those two North American countries, down from 198 million in the same quarter in 2020.

Meanwhile, Meta is investing billions of dollars a year into the metaverse, the yet-to-be developed digital universe that people can access with virtual reality and augmented reality headsets.

Earlier this week, Meta shareholder Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital wrote an open [letter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/altimeter-capitals-brad-gerstner-calls-on-meta-to-slash-headcount.html) to Meta, lambasting the company for employing too many workers and spending too much money on the metaverse.

The firm recommends that Meta reduce its head count by 20% and trim its metaverse investment to a maximum of $5 billion a year. Meta’s Reality Labs unit [lost](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/meta-reality-labs-reports-10-billion-loss.html) more than $10 billion in 2021.

“Meta needs to re-build confidence with investors, employees and the tech community in order to attract, inspire, and retain the best people in the world,” Gerstner wrote in the letter. “In short, Meta needs to get fit and focused.”

On Tuesday, [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) reported weaker-than-expected results and said [YouTube advertising revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/youtube-shrinking-ad-business-ominous-sign-for-online-ad-market.html) dropped 2% from a year earlier to $7.07 billion in the third quarter. Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, said the decline “primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spends.”

Recently I've just been trying to get quick scalps here and there with this crazy market movement. I have a margin account where I typically keep an all cash position to trade with. Day traded yesterday all day and I didn't have one red trade. ( I've had days where I've only had red trades but yesterday just happened to click and work for me)

So yesterday I had an all cash position into market close. I bought a position after market when things were tanking (specifically $TSLA at 217.30 and I sold at 4 am in premarket at 219.30) 100 shares both ways. so I profited $200 on the overnight trade.

But when I closed my position in the early hours of the morning I noticed that my account was misrepresenting P/L by a lot it showed that I had overall gains and losses that were different from my actual P/L. Although the monetary value in my account did not reflect that (it was more or less correct my balance was close to where it ought to be so I figured it was a bug) The glitches later cleared up after I went to sleep and woke up again.

But when I woke up I had a negative -$300ish P/L for the day, although the only trade I had made had granted me +$200

Is it possible for this to happen? I contacted support and he explained it but I don't know I just still didn't get it. I don't understand how could be mathematically possible but I just wanted to run it by you guys to see if that this is usual? I don't know if the actual balance on my account reflects correctly, I'm pretty sure it does I just know I'm roughly in the right ballpark","recently trying get quick scalps crazy market movement. margin account typically keep cash position trade with. day traded yesterday day one red trade.

1666828786,267,"Jeff Bezos once said “Treat Google like a mountain. You can climb the mountain, but you can’t move it.” 

He said this because of how powerful Google’s moat was against its search engine competitors like Bing. His approach to Google’s moat still holds true for the next 20+ years against other search engines. However indirectly the moat can be threatened without a competeting search engine because of a growing ad space industry. 

Allow me to illustrate how Meta got to where it is, and why it can parallel with Alphabet. 

Meta has competed against so many social media sites like Tumblr, Vine and today against Tiktok which arguably is the most threatening competitor today. It’s managed to remain to the top social media company in the world with 3 billion users worldwide. It’s likely to keep the number 1 position, yet suffer the biggest financial drawdown it’s ever seen. 

Recently Meta has been threatened by the Apple iOS changes for user privacy, government regulation, and post 2021 the slowing demand for ad service. Probably the largest threat against Meta is itself for the pivot towards the Metaverse which is not clear if it can one done successfully. This all cultimated because its ad service business model is threatened by too many factors. 

In comparison Alphabet has 4 billion users world wide for all its offered services. It’s faces similar challenges to Meta for except the threat of Apple or itself. Despite this, Alphabet investors should consider that the fate of Meta is not immune for Alphabet and in the coming decades. Just like how Apple trounced 10 billion off of Meta’s balance sheet, what if the government did the same in a larger scale for the US v. Google antitrust case. If Alphabet cannot win this case it sets a large precedent against the company and its industry handicapping its potential growth with tighter regulation.

That’s not even the worst of it! We are in a new era of advertising where every company wants to expand into ad service. Walmart and Apple recently have expanded their ad services. With more companies being added on to this list like Amazon, and Tiktok. I am aware that Tiktok or Walmart is not directly a competitor to Alphabet but in reality it’s becoming a threatening competitor as time will show. More companies can steal this market share with their services that retain user attention span and offer more efficient ad space. The Industry of ad service is stagnating revenue growth because its too competitive and it's affecting Meta equally as is Alphabet despite macroeconomic conditions. 

It might be worth asking why would a company choose to advertise on Youtube or Google search if they know they can get more sales centralizing their advertisements on websites that have higher success for product sales. This could be for many reasons like they know their target audience is more reachable on XYZ website or app than a google search. Perhaps people are more likely to have an adblocker activated on a Youtube video over a top search result on a e-commerce website. 

In the end Alphabet will likely be fine in the coming years. But do not think Google and Youtube is not too big to stagnate in this increasing competitive environment where everyone wants to become an ad service company. If it’s threatening enough, you will see Alphabet pivot just like Meta did to keep it’s company growing. This might mean sacrificing free cash flow.

Over 80% of Google’s revenue came from advertising where as Meta had over 90% revenue from advertising. Alphabet could be the next to pivot with its centralized advertising business model.

Edit: People are not reading my post right. Im not saying Google will be extinct or obselete because some other tech will surpass it. What im saying is that Alphabet in the forseeable future might pivot like Meta did because its legacy apps were not sufficient in providing long term revenue growth. Google and Youtube could face this in its growing competitive market for ad space. Will Google die? No. Can it stagnate and grow less, yes. It's up to Alphabet to decide if it remains a growth company or a legacy value company.","jeff bezos said “treat google like mountain. climb mountain, can’t move it.” said powerful google’s moat search engine competitors like bing. approach google’s moat still holds true next 20+ years search engines. however indirectly moat threatened without competeting search engine growing ad space industry. allow illustrate meta got is, parallel alphabet. meta competed many social media sites like tumblr, vine today tiktok arguably threatening competitor today. it’s managed remain top social media company world 3 billion users worldwide. it’s likely keep number 1 position, yet suffer biggest financial drawdown it’s ever seen. recently meta threatened apple ios changes user privacy, government regulation, post 2021 slowing demand ad service. probably largest threat meta pivot towards metaverse clear one done successfully. cultimated ad service business model threatened many factors. comparison alphabet 4 billion users world wide offered services. it’s faces similar challenges meta except threat apple itself. despite this, alphabet investors consider fate meta immune alphabet coming decades. like apple trounced 10 billion meta’s balance sheet, government larger scale us v. google antitrust case. alphabet cannot win case sets large precedent company industry handicapping potential growth tighter regulation. that’s even worst it! new era advertising every company wants expand ad service. walmart apple recently expanded ad services. companies added list like amazon, tiktok. aware tiktok walmart directly competitor alphabet reality it’s becoming threatening competitor time show. companies steal market share services retain user attention span offer efficient ad space. industry ad service stagnating revenue growth competitive affecting meta equally alphabet despite macroeconomic conditions. might worth asking would company choose advertise youtube google search know get sales centralizing advertisements websites higher success product sales. could many reasons like know target audience reachable xyz website app google search. perhaps people likely adblocker activated youtube video top search result e-commerce website. end alphabet likely fine coming years. think google youtube big stagnate increasing competitive environment everyone wants become ad service company. it’s threatening enough, see alphabet pivot like meta keep it’s company growing. might mean sacrificing free cash flow. 80% google’s revenue came advertising meta 90% revenue advertising. alphabet could next pivot centralized advertising business model. edit: people reading post right. im saying google extinct obselete tech surpass it. im saying alphabet forseeable future might pivot like meta legacy apps sufficient providing long term revenue growth. google youtube could face growing competitive market ad space. google die? no. stagnate grow less, yes. alphabet decide remains growth company legacy value company.","['Tumblr', 'Amazon', 'XYZ', 'Meta', 'Apple', 'Google', 'Alphabet']"

Sofi: Millennials like me do not like banks. We like using online only platforms. I have not been inside a bank in, tbh, probably a decade. This is not even touching on the fact that most large banks, whom do not even need to be mentioned by name, were involved in the 2008-2009 sub prime mortgage crisis. Why would anyone with a brain use these shitty companies? 

Tesla: Think Tesla is just vehicles? Think again. I see Tesla continuing to dominate the EV market over the next decade and beyond but also see them helping to invent some outstanding products that are not vehicle related at all. 

Alphabet: Today (10/26/2022) was a bad day for Alphabet (missed earnings). Don't let this fool you. Once the recession is over (I know I am just another internet stranger but I would say the recession is over in mid 2024) Alphabet will begin to soar and will as always be in almost every crevice of our lives like it has been the past 2 decades. 

Roblox: I think of all 5 stocks listed in STARS this one is the most undervalued at the moment. If you believe even a little in the Metaverse then Roblox should be your pick, in my opinion over Meta in fact. 

Salesforce: Tbh I think Salesforce when looking at everything (P/E ratio, earnings, etc) is a little overvalued. Long term this stock is a winner. This company does excellent work, I use them for my workplace all the time and no complaints.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has had a rocky year so far as it confronts macroeconomic headwinds, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Those challenges have coincided with a slowdown in Amazon’s core retail business, as consumers returned to shopping in stores.

Under CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in July 2021, Amazon has responded to rising expenses by aggressively cutting costs across numerous divisions in recent months. It shed warehouse space, halted some experimental projects, shuttered its telehealth service and froze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business.

Still, analysts are expecting Amazon to report solid third-quarter results, thanks to easier comparisons with last year’s numbers and a potential sales boost from its annual Prime Day discount event, which was held in July.

Revenue growth is projected to come in at 15%, marking a return to double-digit expansion after three straight quarters of growth in the single digits.

Another bright spot could be Amazon’s advertising unit, which has been more resilient compared to peers including Meta, Alphabet and Snap, whose ads businesses have gotten whacked due to the economic environment and Apple’s iOS privacy changes last year.

On Tuesday, Alphabet missed expectations for the third quarter, and YouTube’s ad revenue declined for the first time since Google started breaking out results for the streaming video unit. Facebook parent Meta stumbled again on Wednesday, issuing disappointing earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the fourth quarter.

“Besides allocation to TikTok, budget shift to lower funnel activities is the consistent point of feedback in our conversations with marketers this quarter,” said Rob Sanderson, a managing director at Loop Capital who recommends buying Amazon shares, in a recent note to clients. “Amazon is the lowest on the funnel.”

Wall Street will also be paying close attention to Amazon’s fourth-quarter guidance. The forecast could signal how much demand Amazon expects to see during the holiday shopping period. Analysts are already girding for a lackluster season, with online sales expected to grow just 2.5%, according to Adobe.

Earlier this month, Amazon hosted a 48-hour Prime Early Access Sale, which was the first time it has held two major discount events in the same year. The event jump-started the holiday shopping period early, and it could help juice Amazon’s sales in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv are projecting fourth-quarter revenue of $155.15 billion.

Analysts have taken different approaches to their per-share earnings estimates because of Amazon’s hefty investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian, which went public late last year. The plunge in Rivian’s share price forced Amazon to take a combined $11.5 billion markdown in the first two quarters of 2022. However, Rivian shares rebounded a bit in the third quarter, climbing 28%, which could lead Amazon to mark up the investment.

Amazon shares have slid 34% so far this year, while the S&amp;P 500 index has dropped 20% over the same period.

1666981859,1817,"Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, ""Why did the markets go up/down today?""

And there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, ""Because there were more buyers than sellers"" (or vice versa).

Apple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.

However, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.

Some folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.

With all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and ""fly"" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.

Full disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.

There is currently a bubble in ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a ""flight to safety"" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.

I think the moves in these ""value"" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. ""You won't be fired for buying IBM"". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP? You'll still have your job.","whenever there's large upside downside move markets, everyone's thoughts are, ""why markets go up/down today?"" myriad reasons why. end day, simplest truest answer is, ""because buyers sellers"" (or vice versa). apple's earnings yesterday definitely sigh relief investors, cinching much needed win week big-tech earnings misses. however, deserve ~8% upside move single day? know, that's $200 billion move market cap, larger company outside top 50 largest companies globally. quote this, think probably biggest percentage day gain $aapl 10 years. interesting. folks think move exacerbated today eoy mutual funds, maybe there's large one-sided buying skew big fund positioning. folks think another day gamma-squeeze 0 dte calls hammered day long. maybe earnings really good grand scheme big tech earnings misses quarter. end day, trying find rhyme reason moves single day basis drive mad. trying find rhyme reason moves weekly basis also drive mad. said, what's peculiar situation $aapl expensive ever relative nasdaq 100. trying find reasons moves markets impossible, understandable ebb flow markets bear market. similarly dot-com bubble, trashiest stocks implode many months rest market tanked. full capitulation happened, flight safety big-cap tech stocks well. bear markets like these, human nature preserve ""fly"" safety. apple safety net everyone flocking to, believe painful. full disclaimer, bearish year, bullish past couple weeks. earlier week actually thought bottom might markets, worst probably come. today's move $aapl changed view believe still one last shoe drop soon markets. currently bubble ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, believe cohort drive overall market lower next months. apple ring-leader, several others interesting valuations.

A good example of this was yesterday, I bought a significant part of my portfolio in Apple at around $130, I have several months waited for it to hit my sell price of $155 (which it did yesterday) and I didn’t hit the sell button.

# **Dow closes 800 points higher on Friday, registers fourth straight week of gains - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose on Friday despite a tumble in Amazon shares after economic data pointed to slowing inflation and a steady consumer.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 828.52 points, or about 2.6%, higher at 32,861.80. The S&amp;P 500 added nearly 2.5%, to close at 3,901.06. The Nasdaq Composite ended up about 2.9%, to close at 11,102.45.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the major indexes made notable gains. It was the fourth positive week in a row for the Dow, a first since a five-week streak ending in November 2021. The 30-stock index is up 5.7% this week in its best performance since May. It’s also on track for its best month since January 1976.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are up 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively, for the week.
*****
&gt; The stock market has fractured this week as investors dumped technology shares following weak results and outlooks from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta and rotated into economically sensitive stocks that will benefit if the U.S. economy can skirt a recession.
*****
&gt; At the same time, investors have found hope in data that came out over the course of the week indicating inflation may be easing, increasing optimism that the Federal Reserve could break from its trend of 75 basis point rate hikes after the November meeting.
*****
&gt; “Inflation data really wasn’t that bad. The earnings have been not great, but not awful,” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence. “When you have that middle of the road, that helps equity markets.”
*****
&gt; Amazon plunged by 6.8% after the company posted weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and issued disappointing fourth-quarter sales guidance Thursday. Apple shares ended Friday up 7.5%. The tech giant reported weaker-than-anticipated iPhone revenue on Thursday, but beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings and revenue.
*****
&gt; Apple and other more positive performers, like Intel, have given investors footholds within what some see as a particularly tumultuous tech sector, subsequently providing upward pressure to the tech-heavy Nasdaq, said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management. He said the market was also boosted by oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil, up about 1.2% and 2.9%, respectively, after both reported beating expectations before the bell.
*****
&gt; “Apple’s really the lone star, if you will, of the mega-cap tech stocks,” Hatfield said. “It’s just a unique market where bad is terrible, but OK is good, so, on a relative basis, it’s spectacular.”
*****
&gt; The market got a boost after the core personal consumption expenditures price index in September increased 0.5% from the previous month and 5.1% from a year ago, still high but mostly in-line with expectations. This is the preferred gauge of inflation for the Federal Reserve. Personal spending rose 0.6%, more than expected, the data showed.

&gt; # November is Top NASDAQ Month in Midterm Years

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA, S&amp;P 500 (since 1950), and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is best for Russell 1000 (since 1979) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in all year ranges from 1.7% from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 to a solid 2.3% by Russell 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bf7f124e426aed95ecaf43ab170cefe2/bf37b50ec7fbe190-58/s400x600/386442ec3856f155e7a32b91b86aabeb73364d14.jpg))**

&gt; In midterm years, November’s market prowess is relatively unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 14 of the last 18 midterm years since 1950 with an average gain of 2.5%. S&amp;P 500 has also been up in 14 of the past 18 midterm years, gaining on average 2.6%. Small caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 7 of the past 10 midterm years, averaging 3.3%. The only real blemish in the November midterm-year record is 1974 (DJIA –7.0%, the final DJIA bear market bottom was in December).

&gt; # Here Comes The Historically Best Six Months Of The Year For Stocks

&gt; “The farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see.” Winston Churchill

&gt; The bounce off the October lows continues, with October living up to it’s reputation as both a potential bear market killer, but also the best month of a midterm year. Even more interesting is the past eight times the S&amp;P 500 closed green, stocks gained at least 1% as well. That could be another clue that buyers are aggressively adding and the good news is we’ve seen previous streaks like this take place near major bear market lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chart-1-102522.png))**

&gt; Here’s a chart we’ve shared a lot this year, but it still makes sense to share to make sure investors are aware of it. Looking at the first few quarters of a midterm year we find that stocks usually don’t do well. That’s sure happened this year. The good news is this quarter and the next two quarters have in previous years shown to be the strongest out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle. Better times could be coming and knowing history like Churchill told us means the bulls could be smiling soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chart-2-102522.png))**

&gt; Lastly, many investors are aware of “Sell in May and Go Away,” which shows that the historically worst six months of the year for stocks are from May through Halloween. The good news is we are about to leave those worst six months and enter into what has historically been some of the best times for stocks. In fact, looking at the November through April period shows that stocks have been higher every single time during a midterm year going back to 1950. That is 18 for 18 for those counting at home. Sure, six months from now this could be 18 for 19, but as we’ve been noting a lot on this blog lately, we are seeing many signs that a major market low could be taking place.

&gt; # Setting the Record Straight: Best Six Months, Halloween Indicator, Sell in May

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/1ced387dd2cb26dc6c0e897fb72080d8/652e260f9b9d1d41-c9/s500x750/0d34550a6986d9ac345e0496eef4dcf587a1ba00.jpg))**

&gt; It’s that time of year again. The Best Six Months November-April begin next week, and they are even better when they begin in midterm years. But there are the naysayers so here’s the proof. This bar chart from the about to be released 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac is led to Yale Hirsch’s discovery of this pattern and strategy.

&gt; Our Best Six Months Switching Strategy (aka “Halloween Indicator” or “Sell in May”) works. Any research to the contrary that goes back to 1900 on the DJIA (or even further back), is way too far back. Sell in May is an old British saw, soundly based on inherent behavioral finance patterns and the collective cultural behavior of the investment community, but it did not truly become a tradable investment strategy until after WWII.

&gt; The issue with starting way back then is the world is a much different place now than 100-plus years ago. Prior to about 1950, farming was a major portion of the U.S. economy and from 1901-1950, August was the best performing month of the year, up 36 times in 49 years (market closed in August 1914 due to World War I) with an average gain of 2.3%. July was the second-best month, up 31 of 50 with an average gain of 1.5%. June was fourth best, averaging 0.9%. Why, you may ask? Simply: planting, sowing, reaping, and harvesting. As crops were planted and then brought to market and sold, cash began to move and so did the stock market.

&gt; Agriculture’s share of GDP began to shrink post World War II as industrialization created a growing middle class that moved to the suburbs where hard-earned salaries would be spent filling new homes with all the modern conveniences we all take for granted now. Farming became more efficient and fewer and fewer people worked on the farm.

&gt; Suddenly, summer was less about the hard work of harvesting crops and more about vacations and relaxing. As the economy evolved and peoples’ lives changed, the market evolved. June and August went from being top performing months to bottom performing months. August went from #1 to #10 in 1950-2021 with an average DJIA gain of 0.1%. June went from #4 to #9 (0.1% average). The shift in DJIA’s seasonal pattern is clear in the following chart. “Sell in May” is a post WWII pattern, prior to then it would have been “Buy in May”.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c7f66628b752d034080d9e5c2c749064/652e260f9b9d1d41-55/s500x750/a7f2ff323dad4c7a00e5d66772375d9cc9e9793a.jpg))**

&gt; While many market participants are hip to the saying “Sell in May and go away,” most forget to get back into the market in the fall. We like to say, “Buy in October and get yourself sober.” Before folks were keen on the Halloween Indicator which calls for getting long stocks on Halloween and the end of October, we created our Best Six Months Switching Strategy in 1986 and first featured it in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac.

&gt; Back in 1986 we showed how most of the market’s gains were made in the “Best Six Months (BSM)” from November to April and that the market went sideways in the “Worst Six Months (WSM)” from May to October and is most susceptible to major declines during the Worst Six Months. From April 1950 to October, 21 2022 the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2721.33 points versus 1013.35 points in the WSM. These six months combined have produced an average DJIA gain of 7.3% since 1950 compared to an average gain of just 0.8% during the months May to October.

&gt; We have improved the results of the strategy using the MACD technical indicator. Back in 1999 the late Sy Harding enhanced the BSM strategy by employing the late Gerry Appel’s MACD to improve entries and exits and dubbed it, “the best mechanical system ever.” Over the years we have refined the strategy further by corroborating more than one MACD, looking for confirmation across major market indices and taking MACD triggers earlier in the month.

The [stock market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-31-2022-112227074.html) may have come on too hard, too fast in October given the negative news facing investors into year end.

""We believe the October rally in risk assets is really on shaky ground because markets previously were looking for a dovish pivot from the Fed and then they were looking for a pause from the Fed,"" BlackRock Chief Investment Strategist [Wei Li said on Yahoo Finance Live](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/video/china-faces-structural-headwinds-growth-142652024.html) . ""So it feels like markets want to see some positive development in terms of a dovish message from the Fed. But really we are not at that juncture yet because if you look at core inflation, it's still very, very sticky.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 14% in October, on track to notch its best performance since 1976. Gains for the Dow have been rather broad-based — including an 18% increase for JP Morgan and a 13% pop for [McDonald's](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-season-stories-morning-brief-090040849.html) — while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are up 7.5% and 2.5% on the month, respectively.

 

These gains have come despite the threat of even higher interest rates and a subpar earnings season (see warnings from Amazon and Meta). And BlackRock's Li thinks the returning enthusiasm for stocks will be met with a test out of the gate in November, notably from more hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve at its latest policy meeting this week.

""We believe that rates will continue rising,"" Li explained. ""It will peak at 5%. And not too understate it, that's a very, very restrictive territory. In fact, where we are now, at 3.25%, is already restrictive to the economy. So our belief is that in this current supply-constrained environment, the Fed is going to have to engineer a recession in order to bring down inflation. Our assessment is that if they were to want to bring down inflation to 2% reasonably quickly, it represents a 2% shock to the U.S. economy in 2023. It also represents 3 million additional people out of a job, pushing unemployment rate to 5%.""","( may come hard, fast october given negative news facing investors year end.

1667283443,0,"DISCLAIMER: I’m a Meta bull. I do not approve of Zucks management and his tone death attitude but I approve of his vision to an extent, he is just awful at projecting and marketing it. 



What I think will really take off is social media by AR/VR. It’s impossible to tell exactly how as trends change on a dime but my idea is some sort of Vine like social media but from the POV. Mapping the area or scene with LIDAR for your friends and being ‘in’ the post whether in video or still image. This will not happen with this generation and until AR/VR becomes literally about as clutterless as wearing a pair of Ray Bans. We are currently in the generation of mobile phones, the next will be AR/VR. Much like how our parents were in the PC and internet revolution of the 80s and 90s. The next generation will see it as ‘hip’.

I also think e-commerce with AR/VR is going to blow up especially to see what it is your buying to scale and in front of you. How many times have you purchased something on Amazon and wish you had a scale model of the item to manipulate? The enterprise applications for AR/VR are absolutely endless. 

AR/VR will change the way we interact with each other namely when LIDAR aided (for depth) photography is viewable by AR/VR. This already exists, it’s just not mainstream or in consumer hands yet. Imagine getting a VR rendering of your grandma before she passes and having that memory forever. Or you’re on deployment in the military and you get a VR video of your family counting down the days until you’re home. Designing your brand new house and adding all of your furniture models right there. Or shit, a girl on OF selling a VR rendering of herself. 

All of this is already possible (some already being used) and an example of the limitless and practical applications of VR/AR tech. 


The problem is the Zuck is a goober and is instead promoting the wrong shit. People seem to think the metaverse is the sims/second life when it is NOT. Meta is investing a nuclear amount into the tech to support the digital infrastructure behind all of this. 

The ‘metaverse’ is more like another medium to interact with digital technology and information. By definition Runescape and World of Warcraft are both a metaverse but this is how I see the ‘metaverse’ as we all read about on CNBC come alive. How far away from mainstream total adoption to the scale of mobile phones? Who knows but the tech is making lightning progress. Will Meta come out on top long term? Who knows but they are the ones spearheading this and far ahead of everyone else along with having a massive moat and income to continue funding.

1667355242,0,"There is huge demand for cars in both the U.S. and China -- the world’s two largest autos markets -- according to fund manager Steven Glass, who named one automaker to cash in. 

In the U.S. alone, the shortfall stands at five million vehicles, Glass, managing director and analyst at Pella Funds Management, told CNBC’s Street Signs Asia on Monday. “That’s pent-up demand for new vehicles in the U.S. alone, which we think we are going to start seeing next year as supply chains open up.”

Meanwhile, China is also starting to see growth in the autos market once more, after years of decline, according to Glass.

“China has just started to experience growth in its autos market. That market was in decline between 2018 and 2021, but now we have started seeing some growth again,” he added.

## How to play it

His top pick to play the sector is German automaker [BMW](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BMW-DE/).

Glass believes the company is likely to experience cyclical growth next year. It also has a “very well-managed” balance sheet and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 5.5 — a 20-year low. 

Taken together, this makes the stock look “very, very attractive,” he said

BMW has long made clear its intention to challenge [Tesla’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) leadership in electric vehicles. The Bavarian automaker aims to have two million EVs on the roads by 2025 and estimates half of its car sales to comprise EVs by 2030.

Earlier this month, the company [announced plans to invest $1.7 billion](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0404837EN/bmw-group-announces-1-7-billion-usd-investment-to-build-electric-vehicles-in-the-u-s-and-signs-agreement-with-envision-aesc-for-the-supply-of-battery-cells-to-plant-spartanburg?language=en) in its U.S. operations to build EVs and batteries.

Of this investment, $1 billion has been earmarked to prepare BMW’s existing U.S. manufacturing facility in South Carolina to produce EVs.

The German automaker expects to produce at least six [fully electric models](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/bmw-to-build-new-vehicle-at-south-carolina-plant.html) in the U.S. by 2030. 

**″**Going forward, \[the facility\] will also be a major driver for our electrification strategy, and we will produce at least six fully electric BMW X models here by 2030,” BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse said last month.

The remaining $700 million will be used for the construction of a new high-voltage battery assembly center. The company has already announced four additional battery cell factories that will be built in Europe and China to meet its demand for next-generation battery cells.

Shares in BMW are down 12.9% this year, outperforming Tesla, which has lost more than 40% of its market capitalization so far this year. The stock has an average potential upside of 20.6%, according to analyst estimates tracked by FactSet.","huge demand cars u.s. china -- world’s two largest autos markets -- according fund manager steven glass, named one automaker cash in. u.s. alone, shortfall stands five million vehicles, glass, managing director analyst pella funds management, told cnbc’s street signs asia monday. “that’s pent-up demand new vehicles u.s. alone, think going start seeing next year supply chains open up.” meanwhile, china also starting see growth autos market more, years decline, according glass. “china started experience growth autos market. market decline 2018 2021, started seeing growth again,” added. ## play top pick play sector german automaker ( glass believes company likely experience cyclical growth next year. also “very well-managed” balance sheet trading price-to-earnings ratio 5.5 — 20-year low. taken together, makes stock look “very, attractive,” said bmw long made clear intention challenge ( leadership electric vehicles. bavarian automaker aims two million evs roads 2025 estimates half car sales comprise evs 2030. earlier month, company ( u.s. operations build evs batteries. investment, $1 billion earmarked prepare bmw’s existing u.s. manufacturing facility south carolina produce evs. german automaker expects produce least six ( u.s. 2030. **″**going forward, \ also major driver electrification strategy, produce least six fully electric bmw x models 2030,” bmw chairman oliver zipse said last month. remaining $700 million used construction new high-voltage battery assembly center. company already announced four additional battery cell factories built europe china meet demand next-generation battery cells. shares bmw 12.9% year, outperforming tesla, lost 40% market capitalization far year. stock average potential upside 20.6%, according analyst estimates tracked factset.","['BMW-DE/', 'BMW', 'BMW X', 'FactSet', 'models](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/bmw', 'Pella Funds Management', 'CNBC', 'Tesla']"

1667556989,0,"You loss a massive amount of money. The big names out there who are professional investors loss their ass betting wrong. Nothing worked this year. Bonds, stocks, shorts... everything got squeezed down and up in the extreme movements we have been witnessing.

Example/illustration of what I mean by TRIPLE punch down. On Oct-Nov of 2021 the COVID brrrrr cash inyected in the stock market, creating a bubbly, peaked. Bubble burst. But it was only the start.

I am using ARK ETF as it has been the leading indicator of what it was to come to the entire market later, including big names such as MSFT, GOOGL, META and AMAZON

[Triple punch](https://snipboard.io/FPXZ4J.jpg)

Basically: In Jan 2022, everyone thought.... this can't go further down...this is the bottom. Cathy Wood is already crying. Come on!

In Summer 2022: We were ""well... now this was a over-correction, an abuse by the market...this is the bottom. FED PIVOT coming""

And in the last 10 days it has been like: ""Holy shit... is there a bottom? How far this can keep downtrending?"" 

No one has made money here, generally speaking. So even if you had your bets on the safest MSFT or GOOGL, you are now terribly down! Margin Calls everywhere if you were leveraged.

Let's talk about recovering:

We have the biggest opportunity NOW to take positions in safe businesses that have a great management, product, business model and margins. Avoid the ones who are still FCF negative after all or flooding the market with new shares (dillution) to pay tech-employees.

There are companies with low P/E ratios that have a very robust business and are down -50%, -60%, -70%... So to recover the peak, they will do minimum +100% from here. That 100% will help you recover the losses. And when that bounce happens it will happen very quickly. So you don't want to start timing now, that's stupid. 

Are you happy to discuss and share strong companies here?

US Market: GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT and I'd include META as its core business is not worth just the below 10 P/E its trading at... come one. 

UK Market: Homebuilder companies as they tend to not bear any debt ;-)

Any potential year-end stock market rally will be at risk of sputtering out due to tax-loss harvesting opportunities, according to DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he said he is skeptical of any year-end rally because ""everything is down."" 

""There are so many losses to be harvested in every category. The only thing that is up year-to-date is the dollar and commodities. That's it. And the only thing that is up since the Fed started going to 75s \[basis point rate hikes\] is the dollar,"" Gundlach explained.

Not only are stocks down big so far this year, but bonds are too thanks to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes.

 So most investors, whether they own stocks or bonds, should have plenty of opportunities to harvest losses between now and the end of the year. And that means there will be more selling pressure ahead.

""There will be pretty high tax loss selling I would think. I even got a white paper from somebody saying this was the greatest tax loss selling opportunity of a generation. I would say it might be two generations,"" Gundlach said.

Tax-loss selling is a tax optimization strategy that investors and financial advisors often take advantage of in taxable accounts heading into year-end. The strategy involves realizing losses by selling out of losing positions, and then buying back those portfolio positions 31 days later to avoid the tax wash-sale rule.

The strategy allows investors to realize losses that can offset future realized gains, ultimately helping reduce tax liabilities in the long term.

With some widely held stocks like Meta Platforms and Amazon down big year-to-date, investors may be waiting until after the tax-loss harvesting period ends at the start of next year before rushing in to buy.

In the meantime, Gundlach recommends investors stick with bonds as they offer a better value relative to stocks thanks to the rise in interest rates.","( potential year-end stock market rally risk sputtering due tax-loss harvesting opportunities, according doubleline ceo jeffrey gundlach. interview cnbc thursday, said skeptical year-end rally ""everything down.""

A few years ago, I started investing in stocks as a beginner, but as covid hit and tanked a lot of my positions, I starting getting disinterested about it. Checking today, I’m down about 47%, with most stock losing money, and some being the biggest losers (lost significantly after buying high on coin base, Robinhood, etc). I really want to get back into trading now, but it’s really demotivating to see my current positions and how low they are. For some of my stock, I don’t think there is a chance for them to go back to the price that I bought them for. Does anyone have any thoughts on me selling my entire portfolio and re-investing in stocks I think will trend upward (Amazon, Disney)? Is this a good idea if I want to start fresh and want to get back to my initial investment level? What are some cons to selling all my positions now?

Since a few people were asking for my positions, I’ll list a few here for a better perspective:

Robinhood | $36.5
Virgin Galactic Holdings | $26

1667729002,10,"Hello everyone.  


I'll cut to the chase.  
100x by 2030.  
2x by May 2023.  


Lets start.

# BREAKDOWN

&amp;#x200B;

**WHO –** Avellan Space Technology and Science.  
 

**WHAT –** Building satellites that can connect to unmodified cellphones and other IoT devices.  
 

**WHERE –** Technology is being developed in Midland Texas but services will be available all over the world where regulators permit.  
 

**WHY –** Cell towers are profitable for population-dense areas, many places do not have enough population density or infrastructure for cell towers.  
 

**HOW –** ASTS satellites will operate as relays or cell towers in space.  


# RISKS

&amp;#x200B;

1. Technology does not work - If ASTS Blue Walker 3 (BW3) final demonstration satellite fails to unfurl or connect to devices on the ground then the company will be in deep trouble because they wont be able to test their technology.
2. Unfurling of the satellite - Expected to unfurl around the 10th of November. If the satellite fails to unfurl then the technology cannot be tested.
3. Backhaul antennas do not work as intended - Technology cannot be tested.
4. Funding runs out - I'll get into this later.
5. Low level competitors - Oneweb, Project Kuiper, Iridium etc. They all need dishes or special equipment and will not be able to provide the level of service ASTS will be capable off and therefore they are not a concern.
6. High level competitors - Starlink (NOT SPACEX), Apple, lynk etc. They are planning to do something somewhat similar but they claim that their technology will only be capable of doing text messages and perhaps voice calls in the future.
7. Regulatory risks - Sorted out by ASTS partners, the MNOs (Mobile Network Operators).
8. Legal battle risks - ASTS has a patent moat and there's been an increase in the amount of competitors joining the race. Patents are insured by lloyds of london.
9. Newly signed MNOs do not have exclusive MoUs.  


# STRENTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES

&amp;#x200B;

1. First mover advantage.
2. 2400 patent and patent claim moat.
3. Expert Board of Directors.
4. Cult-like investor following.
5. 1.8B+ potential subscribers under MNO MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding).
6. High margin business - Expected margins expected to be 90-95%.
7. No need to own spectrum - Spectrum is super expensive.
8. Bigger satellites than the competition - Physics dictate that better = better if you want to connect to normal phones on the groun.
9. \~25 MNO partners - Competitors dont have this.
10. Classified mission upon completion of commercial testing of BW3 (Private DD suggests defense use case).
11. 50/50 Revenue split - MNOs do the billing, customer acquisition etc. ASTS just sells bandwidth with a wholesaler model. 

   10. BW3/ BB1-5/ BB6+/Starlink Gen 2 sizes in meters.  
7x9/7x9/20x17.8/5x5  

Okay so we've got facts, now lets get some analysis done.  


If the technology doesnt work then ASTS should have enough funds to launch its Blue Bird satellite and conduct some testing on that.  


The satellite is partially unfurled already and that unfurling happened when some very specific factors all happened at the same time. Namely a spy satellite within range of the BW3 satellite, over a gateway among some other factors.  


Backhaul antennas look like they use a motor or servo so there shouldn't be any issue with them.  


Funding runs out - I WILL GET TO THIS LATER I PROMISE.  


The competitors - Starlink is a competitor to traditional MNOs which makes it unlikely for them to receive many partnerships, they need partnerships for the spectrum.  
Apple has a deal with GSAT for an emergency text service but apple can't face MNOs head on because the MNOs will promote android instead.  
Lynk - poor and crap but their satellites connected to phones on the ground. They wont be able to compete against ASTS once ASTS is up.  


ASTS has a first mover advantage in this space. Their satellite is in space.  
Huge patent and patent claim moat, this is a roadblock to those competitors.

Their board of directors, I cant post images but there is an infographic that really shows it well.

Cult like investors - Check your twitter and the ASTS subreddit if you dont believe me.

Lots of **potential** subscribers under the MoUs. Important thing to note is that a lot of potential customers aren't subscribers because there is no coverage where they live. It will take time to get those customers signed up and using the service.   
Not all potential subscribers will sign up for the service, primarily those that live in cities.

MNOs have to buy spectrum so ASTS wont need to.

  


# FUNDING

ASTS has around 200m in cash, is burning around 40m per quarter and expects to pay \~16m per satellite.  
They need 20 satellites to finish their phase 1 constellation.  
I estimate that they need 400-500m in financing.  


Below is separate DD I conducted into ASTS financing which was specifically written for people currently invested in ASTS  
Q2 ER part of a transcript below.

*Griffin, Scott here. I'll take that one. So I think first off,* ***we continue to believe that we qualify under a prospective 5G for America FCC fund****. Details on that have not been released, but still in process, but we continue to believe that we qualify for that based on the rule making from a little while ago, and that's an opportunity for us for sure.* ***And globally, there are similar types of funding available****. We haven't talked about those specifically. But generally speaking, I'd say our message and our story has been pretty well received. And there are -- apart from grants, there's also* ***government-supported debt that's available.*** *And so I think* ***our story continues to resonate well with governments, with regulators.*** *And importantly, as we get closer and closer to a launch, and we delivered a satellite to Cape Canaveral, seeing that satellite,* ***seeing the tangible milestone has been very powerful with a lot of different audiences.*** *But we continue to believe we qualify for that prospective FCC fund, but we're in a wait mode there.*  


 1. Management believes they qualify for the FCC rural 5G fund. I'm not sure when we will receive information whether ASTS will be awarded any funds from that.   
 2. Globally there are similar types of funding and interestingly enough ASTS has offices all around the world including within the EU. I'll be nice though and assume we dont win any funding or grants.  

3. Government supported debt. There is debt available.  My guess is as good as yours but I assume this debt depending on the interest rate will be available if BW3 is a success. 

 4. ASTS story resonates well with governments and regulators (plural). Remember this is cutting/bleeding edge technology. ASTS needs to prove themselves.

 5. Stakeholders want to see BW3 work, they want tangible results. Why bother with more risk when you can get less risk? Why help ASTS when they still have to prove their tech works when you can just wait to see the tech working. 

 6. Updated S-3. If ASTS was planning on diluting to finance the first phase of their constellation then why bother filing a new S-3 which gives the company significantly more flexibility when it comes to funding? 

 7. Dilution hurts Abel more than anyone. Dilution hurts the CFO making these decisions re: financing. Nobody in the company wants dilution.  

8. Strategic investors/MNOs. AT&amp;T's CEO has stated that they believe they're ahead of all competitors. I'm not sure if he meant  Whether it is just the technology that is taking them ahead or if they're completely ahead in the sense that they believe they will be first to market but it is still important. 

 9. Multiple ASTS MNO partners have started selling of tower assets. Perhaps this is being used to pay down their own debts or perhaps some of it will be available to ASTS. Remember that those companies have to do what is best for their investors. 

 10. It is in the best interests of the MNOs partnered with ASTS to ensure that ASTS survives. If ASTS is making 5B then that means the MNOs are also making 5B, this is not chump change.   

11. Some MNOs have great views on how the technology is progressing.  If those MNOs who have engineers helping ASTS, those same MNOs that will be conducting testing WITH ASTS dont believe the tech will work then it was all a pipe dream. But we don't believe that because we have no reason to. 

So my message to all those who are worried about dilution, take a chill pill. If the company does dilute, my estimates put dilution at 15-50% of the current float.  50% of a 100x is a 66.67x. Does that sound like a good deal to you? 

&amp;#x200B;

There is honestly so much more information but I cant fit it all in here.  
I have a link to much more comprehensive DD.  


Alternatively feel free to simply ask a question and I'll do my best to answer it.  


To those who think it's too risky to invest in ASTS.  
Come back in April, by then testing should be complete and financing secured.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is selling millions of Tesla shares again. The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Musk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but it’s possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.

In April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.

Musk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.

Tesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.

# [Stock futures fall slightly as control of Congress is still unclear](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-wall-street-awaits-results-of-midterm-elections.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
&gt; But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
&gt; In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
&gt; “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
&gt; While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
&gt; The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****
&gt; The market’s recent rally occurred at the front end of a strong seasonal period. Historically, stocks tend to rise after midterm elections and the policy clarity it brings, and the final two months of the year are considered a bullish period for investors.
*****
&gt; Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3% premarket after the social media giant announced it will be laying off more than 11,000 workers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was too optimistic about growth and now needs to streamline the company.
*****
&gt; One stock that weighed on futures was Disney, which fell more than 8% in early trading after the entertainment giant missed estimates on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter.

1668037702,1945,"Amazon.com Inc. is the world’s first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year. 

Shares in the e-commerce and cloud company fell 4.3% on Wednesday, pushing its market value to about $879 billion from a record close at $1.88 trillion on July 2021. Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. 

While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. 
The e-commerce giant has shed $1 trillion in market value
  
The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates.

Ok, there's already a lot that has been said about how negative Twitter has been to TSLA. But I think people are still undestimating just how much worse it can get.

Tesla investors are definitely pissed at this deal. One, it drives Elon's focus away from Tesla. Two, it forced Elon to sell TSLA. Three, if Twitter can't shore up its cash flow, Elon will likely have to keep selling TSLA to fund Twitter.

**Elon's erratic behavior is showing more than ever**

I used to think that Elon would make Twitter better. Now I'm not sure. His erratic behavior is showing up more than ever.

He cut half of the engineering staff, realized Twitter needed some fired engineers, while trying to cram untested monetization features into production. He's flip flopping on ideas within hours.

His ideas are half baked. For example, plenty of people got verified as [Lebron James, Trump, Nintendo, Jesus, etc.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve) The site is losing its credibility fast which will scare advertisers.

Users are also complaining about obvious bugs and issues. It's just the beginning.

Worse, people are seeing live how Elon builds products and it's probably scaring Tesla investors that this is how he does things: half baked ideas, empty promises, erratic.

**Twitter's debt repayment is huge and Elon will have to continue to sell TSLA to fund it**

Twitter's debt payments are around \~$1b/year according to some reports. Elon really needs Twitter to start turning the ship around fast and start becoming profitable. It looks like he's trying to throw anything at the wall to get Twitter to increase profits asap.

If advertisers continue to pull out, he's going to have continue to sell his TSLA shares.

He leveraged his Tesla shares to borrow to buy Twitter. If TSLA drops, he's going to have to provide more collateral or get margin called.

**Elon probably doesn't know how to run a social media company**

It's increasingly looking like Elon does not know how to run a social media company. For example, he's demanding changes based solely on his opinion instead of running A/B tests to quantify the change. As someone who ran a ton of A/B tests for a product similar to Twitter's, there can be a lot of unintended consequences when it comes to monetizations. IE. It looks like your change increased revenue by 3% but it drops total revenue by 5% after 2 months.

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls.

*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed out its best week since June as a report on Thursday showing slowing inflation raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; The broader market index added 0.9%, to close at 3,992.93. This brought its gain for the week to 5.9%, its best week since the one ended June 24 of this year. The Nasdaq Composite added about 1.9% to end at 11,323.33 as investors snapped up tech shares on hopes interest rates would ease. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, closing at 33,747.86.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks on Friday shook off a decline in cryptocurrencies. Virtual currencies tumbled sharply this week and once again came under pressure Friday after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned. Bitcoin and ether both declined.
*****
&gt; Still, tech stocks and related crypto stocks rebounded after opening lower Friday. The tech sector in the S&amp;P 500 surged 10% through Friday, its best weekly performance since April 2020. Amazon was up more than 4% on Friday, while Google-parent Alphabet was 2.6% higher.
*****
&gt; The Dow jumped more than 1,200 points on Thursday following a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices for the month of October, giving investors hope that inflation may be cooling. The S&amp;P rose 5.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite surged about 7.4%. It was the best day since 2020 for all three indexes.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields plunged Thursday on the back of the weaker-than-expected inflation print. The bond market was closed on Friday to observe Veterans Day.
*****
&gt; “From an equity market perspective, as long as the threat of much higher rates is out the way, this should remove a major headwind,” Barclays’ head of European equity strategy Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.

&gt; # Banks and Brokers on Fire

&gt; The Financial sector ETF (XLF) has been on fire since its intraday low of $29.59 on October 13th, which was the day of the hotter than expected September CPI report. From that low point on 10/13, XLF is up 20.2%. As shown below, the ETF is currently at the very top end of a wide sideways range that has been in place over the last six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/xlfchartuse.png))**

&gt; Below is a sampling of some of the most well-known banks and brokers that are part of the Financial sector. As shown, names like Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Jefferies (JEF), Raymond James (RJF), and Stifel (SF) are all more than 10% above their 50-DMAs, and the only stock that's not overbought (&gt;2 standard deviations above 50-DMA) is LPL Financial (LPLA), which traded lower on earnings yesterday.

&gt; A quick look at the six-month price charts of the stocks listed in the table above gives you a glimpse into the huge rally that this area of the market has experienced since early October. Investors have seemingly been loading up on them with short-term Treasury yields now significantly higher than the interest rates these banks and brokers are paying customers on deposits.

&gt; # Homebuilders Extended

&gt; Every day we browse through our Trend Analyzer tool (available with a Premium or Institutional membership) to monitor trends and overbought/oversold levels across financial markets. When we got to the homebuilder stocks this morning, we had to do a double-take after seeing some of the recent moves in this space. Have a look at the moves in the snapshot below. Most homebuilder stocks have rallied 12-15% over the last five trading days, leaving them in extreme overbought territory, which means they're more than two standard deviations above their 50-day moving averages. DR Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), and PulteGroup (PHM) are the most extended. Even after the rally in these names over the last week, we'd note that they're still all down sharply year-to-date as the spike in mortgage rates from 3% up to 7%+ has caused activity in the space to slow to a crawl. A drop in those mortgage rates over the last few days was the catalyst for the recent move higher in share prices. If you're wondering which way the homebuilders are likely to trade going forward, keep an eye on interest rates -- that's the entire story these days.

&gt; # A Very Encouraging Inflation Report, Including Goods Deflation (Finally)

&gt; One month does not make a trend, but today’s consumer price index (CPI) report was very positive. Dare I say, it’s probably the best inflation report we’ve seen in about 15 months, especially because there were so many encouraging signs in it. This is a huge relief, and markets appear to be responding in kind. S&amp;P 500 futures were up more than 3% after the CPI report was released and as of lunchtime, the rally continued.

&gt; Let’s walk through it.

&gt; Headline inflation rose 0.4% in October, as expected. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food/energy prices, and is arguably more important for the Federal Reserve (Fed), surprised: rising 0.3% in October, below expectations for a 0.5% jump. This is the lowest monthly increase since September 2021.

&gt; Looking back over the past year, headline inflation is up 7.8%. That’s high but that’s come down from 9.1% in June. A big part of the deceleration was falling energy prices – you can see how the lighter red bars have been making up a smaller portion of inflation over the past few months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-headline-inflation-decelerating-578x800.png))**

&gt; In the chart above, you can see that Food prices continue to make a big piece of inflation (dark red bars). But we got a break here as well. “Food at Home”, i.e. groceries (which make up close to 9% of the inflation basket), rose just 0.4% in October – the lowest in more than a year and well below the average 0.7% monthly increase we’ve seen over the first 9 months of the year.

&gt; # The Goods Deflation We’ve Been Waiting For
&gt; We’ve been talking about how private inflation data has been showing decelerating prices for goods outside energy and food. Just yesterday my colleague Ryan Detrick wrote about collapsing used car prices. Retailers have been telling us for a while that they’re discounting items as well. We’ve just been waiting for the official inflation data to catch up, and looks like it’s doing that, finally.

&gt; There’s a broad list of goods, including used cars, that saw prices fall in October, which is what makes it even more encouraging. The items below make up about 11% of the inflation basket (and 14% of the core basket). Falling household goods prices probably reflect the slowdown in residential activity, as home sales collapse amid higher mortgage rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-table-goods-prices.png))**

&gt; # Are Rents Breaking?
&gt; The best part about goods deflation is that it offsets high services inflation. As you can see below, the blue bars are now below the zero line for the second month in a row. We also got good news in the form of medical care services – which was a function of falling health insurance premiums.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-core-inflation-576x800.png))**

&gt; The biggest part of the inflation basket is Shelter, including rents on primary residences and something called “Owners’ Equivalent Rent” (OER), which is the “implied rent” that owner-occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes. The latter is also determined using rents of equivalent homes as I wrote about a month ago. In other words, OER is effectively a measure of rents, and altogether rents make up a whopping 40% of the core inflation basket.

&gt; And rents have been rising, putting a lot of upward pressure on core inflation. You can see the gray bars in the previous chart growing larger and larger over the past year.

&gt; However, market rents have been decelerating quite rapidly over the last few months – Ryan discussed this just yesterday. The problem is it hasn’t shown up in the official inflation data because of methodological reasons (we wrote about this quite extensively).

&gt; But the official rental data may be beginning to turn. Rent of primary residence rose 0.7% month-over-month and OER rose 0.6% in October, which is lower than what we’ve seen over the previous couple of months. Make no mistake, a 0.7% rise is still a lot – that translates to an annualized pace of 9%, which is why the Fed is really worried about it. But hopefully, the October data is a sign that the official data is beginning to turn and follow the private data, lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-rents-private-vs-offical-599x800.png))**

&gt; # What does this mean for Fed policy
&gt; Perhaps the most important question.

&gt; As I said at the top, one month is not a trend. But this is not random. It jives with all the other leading indicators of prices, which have been showing a deceleration in prices. And now it looks like the official data is catching up.

&gt; With respect to policy, Fed officials are unlikely to change their minds based on one report. They’ll probably need to see at least three of these before starting to view it as “convincing evidence” that inflation is on its way down.

&gt; But what today’s CPI does is that it buys time. Yet another hot inflation print would have put more pressure on the Fed to raise rates even further. By coming out on the soft side, the report increases the odds for a “soft landing” scenario. In other words, inflation and wage growth can (hopefully) come down without the Fed having to ratchet rates higher and higher, which would eventually break the labor market.

&gt; # Haves and Have Nots

&gt; As evident in our Sector Snapshots over the past several days and as we discussed yesterday on Twitter, sector performance has lately been a tale of the haves and have-nots. The areas of the market that possess some of the most heavily weighted stocks, namely Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology, have drastically underperformed other cyclical sectors like Financials, Industrials, and Materials. As a result, relative strength lines have blown out. Shown another way, in the charts below, we show the ratios of each of these sectors relative to the S&amp;P 500. A rising line would indicate the sector is outperforming the broader market and vice versa.

&gt; Communication Services has been in a brutal downtrend in relative strength terms for more than a year now and the recent drop has been steep. While the ratio of Consumer Discretionary to the S&amp;P 500 has been more range bound in recent years, there have been a few wild swings in the past year. The most recent swing lower is leaving it close to the lowest levels since early 2015. Tech's decline has not been nearly as sharp, but the ratio here has nonetheless rolled over to some of the lowest levels of the past few years. Conversely, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all seen their ratios rip higher to the upper end of the past few years' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110922-Ratiosa.png))**

&gt; In measuring just how sharp of moves these ratios have experienced, they have been outright historic. As for the most pronounced moves, the drops in the lines of Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary rank in the bottom percentile of all 10-day moves since 1990 when our sector data begins. The only periods in which the ratios fell by similar degrees, if not by more, were during the Dot Com bubble. While Tech's ratio is at new multi-yea rlows, its decline was large (ranking in the 17th percentile) but not nearly as sharp, standing out much less than the aforementioned sectors.

&gt; Like Tech, the moves in Financials and Materials have also been quite large and rank in the top decile of all 10-day moves, but those are far from records. The outperformance of Industrials on the other hand, has been remarkable. As of yesterday's close, the ratio versus the S&amp;P 500 rose 7.24% over the past two weeks. Only three other days—May 19 through May 21, 2020—since 1990 have seen higher readings.

&gt; # Small Business Labor and Inflation Slumping

&gt; The NFIB released its October data on small business optimism this morning. The headline index was expected to show further deterioration in optimism, and exactly that occurred as the index fell to 91.3 from last month's reading of 92.1 versus expectations of 91.4. This month's reading is off of the spring lows which had surpassed the worst levels from the early stages of the pandemic but remains one of the weakest readings of the past several years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we provide a breakdown of each category of the report. The headline index is now just off the bottom decile of readings as most components are likewise historically depressed. While the report was weak, there were some exceptions with strong showings in labor market metrics like Plans to Increase Employment, Job Openings Hard to Fill, and Compensation.

&gt; Even though these labor market metrics have remained at very high levels from a historical perspective, they have largely been rolling over for the better portion of the past year. Hiring plans as well as the percentage of firms reporting cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues are back to similar levels as the year prior to the pandemic. Meanwhile, actual employment changes are negative (as they have been throughout the pandemic) implying businesses are reporting a net decline in workers. That is in spite of still elevated compensation and a sharp spike higher in compensation plans. In fact, that index is just shy of the peak from the final months of 2021 after a record 9-point month-over-month jump. Companies are also reporting job openings remain hard to fill, although that index has also been on the decline alongside hiring plans. This month, the reading was unchanged at 46, the lowest level since June 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-2.png))**

&gt; Sales components have experienced far greater degrees of deterioration than employment metrics. The outlook for general business conditions has rallied back somewhat in the past few months, but it remains well below its historical range. Given the weakness in small businesses' economic outlook, few report now as an opportune time to expand their businesses. Actual sales changes dropped to -8 in October which matched August for the weakest showing for sales since August 2020. Back in 2020 though, this index was far lower than it is now.

&gt; While the reading on the top line has held up relatively well, high inflation has meant the bottom line has taken a big hit. A net 30% of small businesses reported earnings have fallen. That reading did improve last month, though, as there have been fewer businesses reporting higher prices. In spite of those improvements, each of those indices has a long way to go until returning to what have historically been more normal levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-3.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, a historically low share of businesses are reporting positive sentiment on the economy and that has dampened their hopes of expansion. When questioned on the reason for not expanding, 44% reported economic conditions as the reason. Another 17% reported economic conditions as the reason for uncertainty on whether or not they would expand. Aptly coming out on Election Day, we have highlighted in the past the political nature of the NFIB survey. As such, it should come as little surprise that the next biggest reason for small business hesitancy in expanding has been the political climate. Assuming the survey results react to the current election in a similar way as in the past, a strong election showing for Republicans could provide a boost to small business sentiment and plans for expansion. Finally, given continued high inflation and rates rising to combat it, the next two most widely mentioned reasons to not expand were the cost of expansion and financial conditions and interest rates with a combined 9% of responses.

&gt; # What's Bothering Small Businesses?

&gt; As we noted in an earlier post, the pandemic trends of tight labor markets and high inflation continue to show up in the latest NFIB survey of small business optimism, albeit readings have begun to roll over. The survey also questions firms on what they perceive to be their most pressing problems. Perhaps even more than the other indices in the report, the results of these questions have shown how front and center labor and inflation concerns continue to be.

&gt; As shown below, most problems have seen record or near-record lows. Meanwhile, two-thirds of responses report either cost or quality of labor or inflation as their biggest problem.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-Table.png))**

&gt; At 33%, inflation as the single most important problem has well surpassed the previous record high set during what was a much less dramatic inflationary spell in 2008. Although this reading rose 3 percentage points versus September, it is in the middle of the past few months' range. In other words, inflation is slightly less of a concern than it was a few months ago (which is confirmed by the decline in the higher prices index), but that is certainly not to say it is no longer the single most pressing problem.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; Another third of responses reported either cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues. Quality is the bigger concern of the two—which is normal from a historical perspective—accounting for a 23% share.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-4.png))**

&gt; As we frequently note, the NFIB survey has a tendency to be impacted by politics with a bias towards Republican administrations. For example, during the Bush and Trump years, there was a far lower share of respondents reporting government requirements and taxes as their biggest concerns. With the prominence of inflation, Biden's tenure has resulted in a different scenario in which these issues have been placed on the back burner. Granted, these issues still account for the most pressing problem of a combined 17% of responses. We would also note, these readings have seen some dramatic moves around midterm election months, but those have not always been lasting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-2a.png))**

&gt; Finally, we would note that very few businesses (only 3%) are worried about poor sales. That is a record-low share and unchanged for the third month in a row. As we noted in our discussion of the other areas of the report, that lack of concern for the top line contrasts with businesses' hopes for expansion and the outlook for the economy. In fact, of the reasons given for firms reporting now as not a good time to expand, sales prospects were the least pressing reason given.

&gt; # Beyond the Midterm Elections…Less Uncertainty and Historically Solid S&amp;P 500 Performance

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a5f6008c34de7421fb4219e162491342/1e76828c24e4974c-2b/s500x750/6ec4edf19bebdc462cd466a8ca166dc72a5e9eaa.jpg))**

&gt; It is finally Election Day and hopefully soon the results will start rolling in. Once the outcome is known, it will likely alleviate some of the uncertainty that has been contributing to the market’s volatile trading which could help the market snap out of its Fed-induced funk. In the chart above the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 18 midterm-year elections appear (NASDAQ since 1974). Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election (approximately three months), DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ were higher on average from 6.4% to 9.2%.

&gt; Digging deeper into the data, the following table shows S&amp;P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after the election. 1- and 3-months after the election S&amp;P 500 was higher 77.8% and 88.9% of the time respectively. By 6-months and 1-year after, S&amp;P 500 was always higher, although gains did slow after 6-months. Years when the President’s party lost its majority in Congress are shaded in gray.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_1222_20221103_Midterm_Election_Forward_Table.jpg))**

&gt; The Sweet Spot of the 4-year cycle is now. The headwinds that abound this time around are not entirely unlike past midterm years that have historically been mired by bear markets and uncertain economic and political times. Many of the current concerns do appear to be accounted for by the market’s declines coming into Q4. Inflation does remain stubbornly high despite the Fed aggressively raising rates this year. The Fed’s most recent statement may not have been as dovish as some had hoped for, but it did contain language that suggested the time to slow the pace of increases and possibly even pause hikes is closer now than it was six months ago. The market is likely to remain volatile as it awaits more clarity from the Fed and more signs that inflation is easing. Any back and fill periods by the market are likely an opportunity to consider adding to existing long positions or establishing new longs.

1668280032,0,"Over the past few weeks, I've been witnessing intense debates between the Bulls and Bears claiming that the market has bottomed or the worst is yet to come. For disclosure purposes, I am now fully net long in my individual stock portfolio which consists of mainly semiconductors after buying heavily in the leadup to the CPI number we just encountered. In previous post, I warned against speculating on a Fed pivot and I'm fully aware of the risk for semiconductors and other individual stocks that I own. But that is beside the point. The main question is: ""What level is enough?"" Numerous companies from Amazon to Apple and from Fed Ex to Target have warned of consumer confidence tanking and slowing sales. This is direct evidence of consumer demand falling which should lead to falling inflation. With guidance comes certainty and with certainty comes probability.

Is it more or less short covering that make these type of stocks rally further than other stocks during upswings?

Anyways I'm thinking it's a good trade for a small portion of a portfolio to have some ARKK CARVANA or whatever to make a quick buck and then sell, especially if you're in the red this year as there won't be any gains.

Is there an etf other than ARKK that contains these types of stocks?

I'm thinking maybe IGY or Invescos extended tech etf, but I don't think it contains any weight in stuff like snap, cvna, amc, pton, etc.

I find it interesting that all these ""crap"" companies rallied like 14% the other day!

Must be short covering?

Why would shorts cover? Why do people rush back in to the no earning, risky stuff?

I've heard though that the long dated, no earnings assets are usually the first and fastest to recover.

Why?

For example, CVNA went up 35% this week! Could you imagine if you had a large amount in that?! Whoa!

1668295064,2075,"Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.

Tesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is “actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla’s charging connector as a public standard.”

The charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.

Tesla claims that its charging connector and charge port — which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS) — is the most common charging standard in North America. It’s a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger stations in the United States. Each station has an average of nine chargers.

Tesla didn’t name any automakers or charging infrastructure companies as converts. In this highly competitive environment, in which virtually every automaker is now using the CCS, it’s hard to see GM, Ford and Stellantis switching to Tesla’s technology.

However, at least one company — EV startup Aptera — supports the move. Earlier this year, Aptera called for the U.S. government to adopt Tesla’s Supercharger technology as the standard for all EV charging in the country. And EVGo has added Tesla connectors to some of its charging stations in the United States.

The company said in the blog post that network operators “already have plans in motion” to incorporate NACS at their chargers. If network providers like ChargePoint, EVConnect or Electrify America add NACS, it would allow Tesla owners to charge at these stations without a need for an adapter.

If automakers switch to NACS on its EVs, it would give owners of those vehicles access to Tesla’s North American Supercharging and destination charging networks.

1668373491,165,"This week's casual valuation is Manchester United, one of the biggest football (soccer) clubs in the world, and a public company trading on NYSE.

As always, this post is not financial/investment advice, it is purely for educational/entertainment purposes. It is divided into quite some segments and I hope you enjoy it! Let's get started:

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Manchester United make money?**

In the last twelve months (ending June 2022), the total revenue was £583m and is divided into 4 segments:

1. Broadcasting (37%) - TV rights &amp; MANU TV (a monthly subscription offering for the fans in exchange for exclusive content)
2. Sponsorships (25%) - self-explanatory, related to the main sponsor, but also all the advertisements around the pitch
3. Matchday (19%) - Sale of tickets
4. Retail, merchandising, apparel (19%) - Sale of branded clothing

It is quite clear that the last 2 segments depend on the fans and whether they are willing to support the club or not. If we add the MANU TV portion on top, it is quite clear that the fans contribute at least 40% of the total revenue and are significant stakeholders. Therefore, they have every right to demand changes when it comes to the players/managers or even owners, as they keep the club alive to some extent.

**How does Manchester United spend money?**

Looking at the income statement for the same period, all of the expenses amounted to £692m, yes, higher than the revenue. We can divide this into 3 brackets:

1. Employee benefits (55%) - Related to the salaries of the players, managers as well as all of the staff employed by the club
2. Other operating expenses (23%) - One bucket where all the other expenses related to the operations are included
3. Amortization (22%) - Related to the contracts of the players signed

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

From the information above, it is clear that the club isn't profitable. Was it always the case? Not really. If we go back to 2018, the revenue earned was quite similar, but the expenses were £564m, leading to a profit of £25m (4% operating margin). Wait, but that is quite a low margin, isn't it? Absolutely! But that should not come as a surprise. Sports clubs in general are not a great investment, and we will see some examples below.

However, this isn't a start-up that will improve margins over time as it scales up. We're looking at a club that's 100+ years old and struggles to be profitable. So, how can we value it?

Of course, if we plug the numbers into a DCF, well, the outcome is, it is worthless! It's not creating wealth! Not only that, it has £124m in cash and £806m in debt (including unearned revenue)!

&amp;#x200B;

**The wishful thinking valuation**

Let's perform a simple exercise, which I refer to as a wishful thinking valuation. In this scenario, the club's revenue increased by 40% (due to better and more lucrative sponsorship deals, higher apparel sales, more matches played in important competitions, etc). At the same time, the expenses are slightly lower, leading to an operating profit of around £150m.

In addition, let's also assume that the club is consistently successful in delivering this profitability over time. Are these unrealistic assumptions? Very likely.

Even in this case, the value of the football club is around £1,5b before adjusting for what's on their balance sheet. Once we do that, the value declines to roughly £800m. That's extremely low! In fact, that's about 45% of the company's market cap today (Keep in mind the company's share price is always in $ as it is trading on the NYSE, while the financial numbers are in £).

So, in the best-case scenario, under unrealistic assumptions, its value is under £1b.

Wait, that cannot be the case. This is one of the biggest clubs in the world with over 75m fans!

&amp;#x200B;

**What's actually going wrong?**

*One of the fastest ways to become a millionaire is to become a billionaire and then buy a sports team.*

It's not only Manchester United that struggles to find a way to profitability, but almost all of the clubs! Football Benchmark has an annual report and one segment focuses on profitability. It covers the top32 clubs. The outcome? Back in 2016, all of the 32 clubs had a net loss of €156m on €7,7b revenue (I know, it's in €, who needed a third currency in this post, but well, it is what it is). In 2022, the loss was almost €2,7b on almost €10b in revenue.

There are only a handful of clubs that are public. Juventus is one of them, with the share price being down over 75% since 2001, Borussia Dortmund is a bit better with the share price declining just almost 60% since 2000.

Manchester United's share price is pretty much flat since 2012.

&amp;#x200B;

**Emotional stock-price volatility**

There are many places where the emotions of human beings play and the stock market is definitely one of them. The share price of the football clubs also changes based on events that have overstated significance. Here are a few examples:

\- During the 2013 transfer period, Manchester United announced the signing of the midfielder Fellaini and the share price increased.

\- Manchester United's share price decreased over 9% on the speculation that the club might sign Ezequiel Garay.

It's not only Manchester United, take a look at the share price of Juventus, it went over 3x on the news of signing Ronaldo.

Don't get me wrong, these events have some (minor) impact on the success of the club during a short period of time. In the case of Ronaldo, it might even come with better sponsorship deals, higher ticket prices, and more apparel sales. However, it also comes with an additional cost (an obvious one, his salary!). In the long run, none of these events have an impact on the value of the clubs.

&amp;#x200B;

**The transfer window**

When I was in university, I looked at this and thought, what is the most emotional period during the year? It has to be the summer transfer window.

So, I took a shortcut and looked at the performance of the share price of Manchester United since 2013 for the period between June 10th and September 1st. The outcome?

&amp;#x200B;

||Manchester United|S&amp;P500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2013|\-1%|\-1%|
|2014|\-3%|3%|
|2015|7%|\-6%|

|2021|11%|7%|
|2022|11%|1%|
|**Total compounded return**|**32%**|**29%**|

As always, not financial advice, but definitely a fun insight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pricing, not valuation**

In my opinion, this belongs in the ""Pricing, not valuation"" bucket. The same bucket as art, collectibles, watches, vintage cars, and the most expensive Pokemon Card. None of them produce cash flow, hence, applying the traditional financial models leads to the outcome that they are worthless. 

Is that the case? Not really.

They're worth as much as the price that the next person is willing to pay. This is the only way that the current owners can actually make money.

&amp;#x200B;

Sports clubs seem like another toy/possession for billionaires as if they're going through a checklist.

An expensive car? Check

A yacht? Check

Private jet? Check

Seventeen properties? Check

Hmm, what else? Oh yeah, maybe a sports club!

&amp;#x200B;

**Credit Suisse and their failed attempt to value Manchester United**

Back in 2015, Credit Suisse published an equity report valuing Manchester United. I'm not sure if anyone is reviewing valuations there, as this one was based on irrational assumptions. The valuation lead to the value of Manchester United being £2,5b. Here's how:

1. They assumed Manchester United will be profitable every single year in the future and the profits will increase over time. Comparing their forecasts to the actuals, they are quite far off. Not only that, but we already know the club is currently unprofitable.
2. For the calculation of the terminal value, they used **EBITDA** and applied a multiple. If anyone read the first part of the post, you already know that this is just dumb. using EBITDA excludes amortization that covers the players' contracts! Of course, this pushes the profitability up without taking all expenses and voila, the valuation is done. Not only that, the multiple used was 12x.

Apologies if the post was too long, I wanted to share all the information that I thought are relevant and I hope you enjoyed it.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the change in the selling price of goods and services sold by producers. The PPI measures price change from the perspective of the seller. When producers pay more for goods and services, they are more likely to pass the higher costs to the consumer, so PPI is thought to be a leading indicator of consumer inflation.

1668390923,0,"*Short term noise*

$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. 

*”DD”*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, they’re an outlier and leader within the car industry with a forward PE of only 35 and earnings growth ~100% I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

# [Stock futures fall following the S&amp;P 500′s best week since June](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures traded lower Monday after the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest weekly gain in almost five months on the back of easing inflation data.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 49 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid by 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 5.9% last week for its best week since June. Investors cheered a lighter-than-expected inflation reading, betting that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its aggressive tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; “A notable shift has occurred in the market, with investors increasingly risk-on across asset classes,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research. “Technical indicators have improved dramatically, with investor sentiment, momentum, breadth, and risk factors all showing notable improvement.”
*****
&gt; The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 8.1% last week for its best week since March, while the blue-chip Dow advanced 4.2%.
*****
&gt; The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge or the VIX, fell 1 point to 22.5, hitting the lowest level since August. The VIX, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&amp;P 500, had traded above the 30 point threshold for most of October.
*****
&gt; Still, the Federal Reserve has given little signal that it could deviate from its tightening path anytime soon. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Sunday that, “We’re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace.” But, “we’re not softening. ... Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be. Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.”
*****
&gt; Investors also digested news on the politics front over the weekend. Democrats will keep control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections, NBC News projected. The party will hold at least 50 seats after Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada held off challenges.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season is set to continue, with a heavy emphasis on retail. Big retailers Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Lowe’s, Macy’s and Kohl’s are all slated to post numbers this week.

1668441635,1114,"The job cuts of approximately 10,000, which would start as soon as this week, would focus on the company’s devices organization, retail division and human resources.

Amazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, people with knowledge of the matter said, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history.

The cuts will focus on Amazon’s devices organization, including the voice-assistant Alexa, as well as at its retail division and in human resources, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The total number of layoffs remains fluid. But if it stays around 10,000, that would represent roughly 3 percent of Amazon’s corporate employees and less than 1 percent of its global work force of more than 1.5 million, which is primarily composed of hourly workers.

Amazon’s planned retrenchment during the critical holiday shopping season — when the company typically has valued stability — shows how quickly the souring global economy has put pressure on it to trim businesses that have been overstaffed or underdelivering for years.

Amazon would also become the latest technology company to lay off workers, which only recently it had been fighting to retain. Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant more than doubled the cap on cash compensation for its tech workers, citing “a particularly competitive labor market.”

Changing business models and the precarious economy have set off layoffs across the tech industry. Elon Musk halved Twitter’s head count this month after buying the company, and last week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced it was laying off 11,000 employees, about 13 percent of its work force. Lyft, Stripe, Snap and other tech firms have also laid off workers in recent months.

Brad Glasser, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.

The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record, as consumers flocked to online shopping and companies to its cloud computing services. Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.

But earlier this year, Amazon’s growth slowed to the lowest rate in two decades, as the bullwhip of the pandemic snapped. The company faced high costs from decisions to overinvest and rapidly expand, while changes in shopping habits and high inflation dented sales.

Amazon experienced a slight rebound in its latest quarter. But it has cautioned investors that growth could weaken again, possibly falling to its lowest pace since 2001.

The Anatomy of a Panic Attack

Giorgia Meloni and the Politics of Power Dressing
The company has told Wall Street that it has tightened its belt in the past and can do so again. Last week, Amazon executives met with institutional investors, according to three people, just as its stock sank to its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic, erasing $1 trillion in value since Andy Jassy took over as chief executive last year.

Mr. Jassy, who previously ran Amazon’s lucrative cloud computing business, has been closely scrutinizing businesses to trim costs quickly. He initially pulled back on a warehouse expansion that was supercharged during the pandemic, then moved to other parts of the company.

In recent months, Amazon has also closed or pared back a smattering of initiatives, including Amazon Care, its service providing primary and urgent health care that failed to find enough customers; Scout, the cooler-size home delivery robot, that employed 400 people, according to Bloomberg; and Fabric.com, a subsidiary that sold sewing supplies for three decades.

From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.

Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.

That news came so suddenly that recruiters did not receive talking points for job candidates until almost a week later, according to a copy of the talking points seen by The New York Times.

Devices and Alexa have long been seen internally as at risk for cuts. Alexa and related devices rocketed to a top company priority as Amazon raced to create the leading voice assistant, which leaders thought could succeed mobile phones as the next essential consumer interface. From 2017 to 2018, Amazon doubled staff on Alexa and Echo devices to 10,000 engineers. At one point, any engineer getting a job offer for other Amazon roles was supposed to also get an offer from Alexa.

The company has sold hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. But Amazon has said the products are often low margin and other potential revenue sources such as voice shopping have not caught on.

In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.

Amazon’s retail business, which covers its physical and online retail business and its logistics operations, has been under strain after the surge of demand and breakneck expansion during the pandemic. The company has said it has pulled back expansion plans, and has told investors it sees uncertainty with consumers.

“We’re realistic that there’s various factors weighing on people’s wallets,” Brian Olsavsky, the finance chief, told investors last month. He said the company was unsure where spending was heading, but “we’re ready for a variety of outcomes.”

1668703363,191,"*  **Weekly jobless claims fall 4,000 to 222,000**
* **Continuing claims increase 13,000 to 1.507 million**
* **Housing starts drop 4.2% in October; permits fall 2.4%**

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, showing widespread layoffs remain low despite a surge in technology-sector job cuts that has raised fears of an imminent recession.

The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, suggested the labor market remained tight. That, together with strong retail sales growth in October, will keep the Federal Reserve on track to continue raising interest rates, though at a slower pace amid signs inflation is starting to subside.

""This is a testimony to how tight the labor market remains,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Nov. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims for the latest week.

There has been an increase in layoffs in the technology sector, with Twitter, Amazon and Meta, the parent of Facebook, announcing thousands of job cuts this month. Companies in interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing and finance are also letting workers go.

The layoffs have so far not been evident in official data. Unadjusted claims dropped 6,101 to 199,603 last week. Claims in California, the epicenter of the technology job cuts, rose by only 302 last week. Big decreases in claims were reported in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas, offsetting notable increases in Minnesota and North Carolina.

Economists say businesses outside the technology and housing sectors are hoarding workers after difficulties finding labor in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in September, some of the workers being laid off are probably finding new employment quickly.

Economists at Goldman Sachs dismissed worries that the technology layoffs were flagging an imminent recession in a note this week. They argued that technology job openings remained well above their pre-pandemic level. They also noted technology-sector layoffs have not historically been a leading indicator for deterioration in the overall labor market.

""Announced tech job cuts have frequently spiked without a corresponding increase in cuts in other sectors and have otherwise been a coincidental indicator,"" they wrote.

The Fed has raised its policy rate by 375 basis points this year from near zero to a 3.75%-4.00% range as it battles high inflation in what has become the fastest rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s. So far, the economy is weathering the tighter monetary policy storm, with data on Wednesday showing strong retail sales growth in October.

U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

## HOUSING STARTS FALL

The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. Claims rose marginally between the October and November survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job growth. The economy created 261,000 jobs in October.

Next week's data on the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid will shed more light on November's employment report. The so-called continuing claims, a proxy for hiring, increased 13,000 to 1.507 million in the week ending Nov. 5, the claims report showed.

But the housing market is crumbling under the weight of higher borrowing costs.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed housing starts decreased 4.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.425 million units last month. Economists had forecast starts would slide to a rate of 1.410 million units. Housing starts dropped 8.8% on a year-on-year basis in October.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, tumbled 6.1% to a rate of 855,000 units, the lowest level since May 2020. Single-family homebuilding declined in all four regions.

Starts for housing projects with five units or more slipped 0.5% to a rate of 556,000 units. Multi-family housing construction has fared better as soaring mortgage rates force many potential homebuyers to remain renters. A key gauge of rents surged by the most on record on a year-on-year basis in October, according to the latest consumer price data.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging above 7%, the highest level since 2002, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.

Data on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders fell for an 11th straight month in November.

Permits for future home construction fell 2.4% to a rate of 1.526 million units in October. Single-family building permits dropped 3.6% to a rate of 839,000 units.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more slipped 1.9% to a rate of 633,000 units.

# A note from CEO Andy Jassy about role eliminations - Thursday, Nov 17, 2022:

Two weeks ago, Beth shared that S-team and I decided to pause new incremental hires in our corporate workforce. Today, I want to share some information about role eliminations. We are in the middle of our annual operating planning review where we look at each of our businesses and make decisions about what we believe we should change. Leaders across the company are working with their teams and looking at their workforce levels, investments they want to make in the future, and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year’s review is more difficult due to the fact that the economy remains in a challenging spot and we’ve hired rapidly the last several years.

Yesterday, we communicated the difficult decision to eliminate a number of positions across our Devices and Books businesses, and also announced a voluntary reduction offer for some employees in our People, Experience, and Technology (PXT) organization. Our annual planning process extends into the new year, which means there will be more role reductions as leaders continue to make adjustments. Those decisions will be shared with impacted employees and organizations early in 2023. We haven’t concluded yet exactly how many other roles will be impacted (we know that there will be reductions in our Stores and PXT organizations), but each leader will communicate to their respective teams when we have the details nailed down. And, as has been the case this week, we will prioritize communicating directly with impacted employees before making broad public or internal announcements.

I’ve been in this role now for about a year and a half, and without a doubt, this is the most difficult decision we’ve made during that time (and, we’ve had to make some very tough calls over the past couple of years, particularly during the heart of the pandemic). It’s not lost on me or any of the leaders who make these decisions that these aren’t just roles we’re eliminating, but rather, people with emotions, ambitions, and responsibilities whose lives will be impacted. We are working to support those who are affected and trying to help them find new roles on teams that have a need; and in cases where that’s not possible, we are offering packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.

Amazon has weathered uncertainty and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so. We have big opportunities ahead, both in our more established businesses like Stores, Advertising, and AWS, but also in our newer initiatives that we’ve been working on for a number of years and have conviction in pursuing (e.g. Prime Video, Alexa, Kuiper, Zoox, and Healthcare). The key will be to do what Amazon does best – obsess over customers and invent relentlessly on their behalf – and if we do that, we should all be very optimistic about Amazon’s future. I know I am.

I want to thank each of you for your continuing contributions during this challenging time and as we gear up to deliver for customers during the busy shopping season.

Thanks,Andy

Despite briefly dipping below, TSLA did close above support coming from the August 2020 highs at 167.50. This level may have added significance from a technical standpoint, as the breakout in November 2020 is what took the stock into ""new-high"" territory. Buyers may therefore eye this level as a good area for accumulation which could help the stock form a base, or even begin a rebound if longer-term investors also look to add to their positions.

# [Stock futures are slightly higher as investors look ahead to Fed meeting minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were marginally higher on Wednesday morning, as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve meeting minutes for clues into the pace of future interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points points, or 0.1. S&amp;P 500 futures also gained 0.1% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; Shares of Nordstrom fell more than 8% in the premarket after the department store chain reaffirmed its forecast. However, Nordstrom beat profit and sales expectations in its latest results, according to consensus expectations on Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.
*****
&gt; Investors shrugged off fears of further lockdowns in China after the country reported its first Covid deaths since May. Instead, traders focused on some strong earnings reports, and bet on the likelihood for an easing in monetary policy from the Fed going forward.
*****
&gt; “Investor psychology remaining optimistic is driving the rally in this market,” Eugene Profit, CEO at Profit Investments, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “Going into the next Fed meeting, I think the Fed will probably moderate their language a little bit, and I think investors want to remain optimistic, and ignore a lot of headwinds in this market,” he added.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors will review the latest Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday for insight into the central bank’s approach on monetary policy ahead of the December meeting.
*****
&gt; Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008. Economists are forecasting a half percentage point increase in December, and smaller rate hikes next year.
*****
&gt; Additionally, investors will parse through the latest jobless claims data. Economists polled by Dow Jones are forecasting claims of 225,000 for the week ending Nov. 19, a slight increase from the 222,000 initial claims the prior week.
*****
&gt; They’re also expecting the latest data on durable goods and new home sales in October. Durable goods in October are expected to have risen 0.5% from the prior month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will close early on Friday.

1669268824,200,"Tesla (Tesla Inc.) market value in two months evaporated nearly $ 300 billion, but now, a growing number of Wall Street analysts have begun to say that the company's shares have fallen enough to advise investors not to miss this round of buying opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

As of Wednesday's U.S. stock close, Tesla was trading at $183.20, up nearly 8 percent, the biggest one-day gain since July.

&amp;#x200B;

Morgan Stanley (Morgan Stanley) analyst Adam Jonas said earlier that Tesla is approaching his ""bear market target price"" of $ 150, which provides investors with the opportunity to buy at a lower price. Citi analysts also raised the stock's rating to neutral from sell, saying the stock's more than 50 percent decline this year ""offsets short-term risk/reward.

&amp;#x200B;

Jonas wrote in a report that Tesla is the only electric car maker in Morgan Stanley's survey that is profitable through car sales, despite challenges such as slowing demand and price cuts in China.

&amp;#x200B;

The analyst reiterated his $330 price target. He also highlighted the potential for Tesla to benefit from consumer tax credits in the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

No coincidence. Citi analyst Itay Michaeli also upgraded the stock on Wednesday, giving him a $176 price target, one of the lowest on Wall Street. The analyst said he has become more optimistic because Tesla's plunge means some of the stock's overly optimistic expectations have now been repriced.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla's shares have plunged this year due to rising raw material costs, production and sales problems and customer budget pressures. Recent distractions from the company's CEO Musk, who is focused on turning around Twitter, have also dampened market sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

Jonas said that to stop the decline in the stock price, it is necessary to end the disruption caused by Twitter. He wrote, ""There has to be some form of sentiment 'meltdown mechanism' around the tweets to calm investor concerns about Tesla.""

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all the challenges Tesla has faced this year, Wall Street has remained largely optimistic. Most Tesla analysts have a Buy or Neutral rating on the stock, although the stock is currently 57 percent away from the average analyst target price.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, Tesla's plunge this year has reduced the stock's expected price-to-earnings ratio from more than 200 times in early 2021 to 31 times now.","tesla (tesla inc.) market value two months evaporated nearly $ 300 billion, now, growing number wall street analysts begun say company's shares fallen enough advise investors miss round buying opportunities. #x200b; wednesday's u.s. stock close, tesla trading $183.20, nearly 8 percent, biggest one-day gain since july. #x200b; morgan stanley (morgan stanley) analyst adam jonas said earlier tesla approaching ""bear market target price"" $ 150, provides investors opportunity buy lower price. citi analysts also raised stock's rating neutral sell, saying stock's 50 percent decline year ""offsets short-term risk/reward. #x200b; jonas wrote report tesla electric car maker morgan stanley's survey profitable car sales, despite challenges slowing demand price cuts china. #x200b; analyst reiterated $330 price target. also highlighted potential tesla benefit consumer tax credits united states. #x200b; coincidence. citi analyst itay michaeli also upgraded stock wednesday, giving $176 price target, one lowest wall street. analyst said become optimistic tesla's plunge means stock's overly optimistic expectations repriced. #x200b; tesla's shares plunged year due rising raw material costs, production sales problems customer budget pressures. recent distractions company's ceo musk, focused turning around twitter, also dampened market sentiment. #x200b; jonas said stop decline stock price, necessary end disruption caused twitter. wrote, ""there form sentiment 'meltdown mechanism' around tweets calm investor concerns tesla."" #x200b; despite challenges tesla faced year, wall street remained largely optimistic. tesla analysts buy neutral rating stock, although stock currently 57 percent away average analyst target price. #x200b; addition, tesla's plunge year reduced stock's expected price-to-earnings ratio 200 times early 2021 31 times now.","['Tesla (Tesla Inc.', 'Nestle', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Tesla']"

# [Stock futures fall as unrest in China grows over Covid restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/27/stock-futures-slip-after-a-winning-holiday-week-.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China’s prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower — after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing’s zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world’s second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
&gt; The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&amp;P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
&gt; “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
&gt; In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

# [S&amp;P 500 futures rise as China Covid concerns ease](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Futures connected to the S&amp;P 500 rose Tuesday as worries over unrest in China and its Covid protocols appeared to ease.
*****
&gt; The broad index’s futures added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded near flat.
*****
&gt; The move follows stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rallying overnight as a Chinese official told reporters that 65.8% of people “over age 80” had received booster shots. On top of that, the government reported the first decline in Covid infections within mainland China in more than a week.
*****
&gt; Those updates follow the declines in U.S. and foreign markets seen Monday after protests in mainland China against the country’s zero-Covid policy started over the weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly fell to their lowest point since last December while all three of the major U.S. indexes ended the day down more than 1% as investors grew increasingly concerned about if Chinese Covid protocols could hamper global supply chains.
*****
&gt; “There’s some real reasons to be cautious. The market’s rallied a lot this quarter, and there’s some concerns that things are going to slow, so I think it’s a kind of balanced risk reward,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “I think there was an excuse with maybe some China slowdown fears for people to collect a little profit that they made in the quarter,” he added.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders will watch for the September reading of the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index that is due Tuesday before the bell. The report will give investors insight into how higher interest rates are affecting the housing market. Home prices in the prior month jumped about 13% year over year.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the latest reading on consumer confidence is set to release at 10 a.m. Wall Street is also expecting the latest corporate earnings results from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tuesday after the bell.
*****
&gt; Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings on Wednesday. Investors will be listening for insight into the central bank’s fight against inflation.

1669946246,638,"Tesla Semi *delivery* event has happened, the first delivery actually happened yesterday to Pepsi. 

500 mile range at 82,000 lbs real world test. Right off the factory line, onto the road. There was no aero package added and no weight change, and the truck only stopped once so the driver could use the bathroom. 

During this real world test, brakes were actually cold at the mandatory brake check on route. Which is in place so drivers that normally would have extremely hot brakes don’t end up experiencing brake failures due to high temperatures. This is because the regenerative brake system on the Tesla semi works extremely well, to the point where the brakes are almost not needed. Think of it kind of like an engine brake on a diesel truck, but instead of just slowing down the truck it now also charges the battery. 

Price was not discussed, weight was not discussed. 

It’s clear that this will operate extremely well on shorter routes with its current range, but will not be as useful on larger trips. The argument can be made that laws don’t allow drivers to drive continuously without breaks, but the Semi is still a little short even with these breaks accounted for. I imagine as battery density gets better this will change. Along with the fact that these electric semi (on paper) will be *far* cheaper to operate, possibly offsetting downtime (charging time) costs. 

Over the average lifetime of a Semi, Tesla semi can save $600k to a million+ just in fuel. (Depending on charging rates) That doesn’t account for possible (and highly likely) maintenance cost savings. 

TLDR: Tesla Semi is a beast and obvious choice for anything under the ~500 mile routes, as routes get longer more consideration will be needed. 

Also to all the doubters, Tesla may be late, wrong, or seem completely insane sometimes but I think it’s fair to say that they do deliver.","tesla semi *delivery* event happened, first delivery actually happened yesterday pepsi. 500 mile range 82,000 lbs real world test. right factory line, onto road. aero package added weight change, truck stopped driver could use bathroom. real world test, brakes actually cold mandatory brake check route. place drivers normally would extremely hot brakes don’t end experiencing brake failures due high temperatures. regenerative brake system tesla semi works extremely well, point brakes almost needed. think kind like engine brake diesel truck, instead slowing truck also charges battery. price discussed, weight discussed. it’s clear operate extremely well shorter routes current range, useful larger trips. argument made laws don’t allow drivers drive continuously without breaks, semi still little short even breaks accounted for. imagine battery density gets better change. along fact electric semi (on paper) *far* cheaper operate, possibly offsetting downtime (charging time) costs. average lifetime semi, tesla semi save $600k million+ fuel.

Amazon Web Services has been the biggest growth engine for its parent company over much of the past decade, taking business from some of the largest tech vendors in the world. But as corporations face the most daunting economic environment since the 2008 financial crisis, those massive checks they’re writing to AWS for their tech infrastructure are getting greater scrutiny. Peter Kern, CEO of online travel company Expedia Group, sees the cloud as an area where his company can reduce its fixed costs. In recent years, Expedia has moved considerable parts of its operations to AWS from on-premises data centers. “We haven’t fully optimized the cloud,” Kern said during the company’s earnings call last month. “We’ve moved a lot of technology into the cloud, but we have a lot of work to do.”

The National Football League, which uses AWS to produce statistics and schedules, is making conservative plans around costs, said Jennifer Langton, the NFL’s senior vice president of health and innovation. “We are not recession proof,” Langton told CNBC during an interview at AWS’ annual Reinvent customer conference in Las Vegas this week. The league is negotiating with AWS on the terms of a renewed multi-year agreement, and there are some areas her organization wants to prioritize, she said. AWS is coming off its slowest period of expansion since at least 2014, the year Amazon started reporting on the group’s finances.

AWS isn’t the sole big cloud provider that’s dealing with customers’ budget constraints. In the third quarter, Microsoft’s Azure consumption growth moderated as the company helped clients optimize existing workloads, finance chief Amy Hood said in October. Amazon leads the market in cloud computing, with an estimated 39% share. “If you’re looking to tighten your belt, the cloud is the place to do it,” AWS CEO Andy Selipsky said during his keynote presentation in front of over 50,000 people on Tuesday. Selipsky said that moving IT jobs to the cloud could help budget-strapped organizations save money, citing customers Agco and Carrier Global.

Not everyone agrees. Last year, investors Sarah Wang and Martìn Casado of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz published an analysis, showing that a company could trim its computing costs by half or more by bringing workloads from the cloud back to on-premises data centers. Selipsky told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview that AWS teams are working with customers that are trying to become more efficient. “We do see some customers who are doing some belt-tightening now,” Selipsky said. One example is data analytics software maker Palantir, which said last month its operating profit in the third quarter was higher than expected primarily because of cloud and deployment efficiencies.","amazon web services biggest growth engine parent company much past decade, taking business largest tech vendors world. corporations face daunting economic environment since 2008 financial crisis, massive checks they’re writing aws tech infrastructure getting greater scrutiny. peter kern, ceo online travel company expedia group, sees cloud area company reduce fixed costs. recent years, expedia moved considerable parts operations aws on-premises data centers. “we haven’t fully optimized cloud,” kern said company’s earnings call last month. “we’ve moved lot technology cloud, lot work do.” national football league, uses aws produce statistics schedules, making conservative plans around costs, said jennifer langton, nfl’s senior vice president health innovation. “we recession proof,” langton told cnbc interview aws’ annual reinvent customer conference las vegas week. league negotiating aws terms renewed multi-year agreement, areas organization wants prioritize, said. aws coming slowest period expansion since least 2014, year amazon started reporting group’s finances. aws isn’t sole big cloud provider that’s dealing customers’ budget constraints. third quarter, microsoft’s azure consumption growth moderated company helped clients optimize existing workloads, finance chief amy hood said october. amazon leads market cloud computing, estimated 39% share. “if you’re looking tighten belt, cloud place it,” aws ceo andy selipsky said keynote presentation front 50,000 people tuesday. selipsky said moving jobs cloud could help budget-strapped organizations save money, citing customers agco carrier global. everyone agrees. last year, investors sarah wang martìn casado venture firm andreessen horowitz published analysis, showing company could trim computing costs half bringing workloads cloud back on-premises data centers. selipsky told cnbc’s jon fortt interview aws teams working customers trying become efficient. “we see customers belt-tightening now,” selipsky said. one example data analytics software maker palantir, said last month operating profit third quarter higher expected primarily cloud deployment efficiencies.","['AWS', 'Martìn Casado', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'Kern', 'BHP Group', 'Expedia', 'CNBC', 'Microsoft', 'Amazon Web Services', 'The National Football League']"
1670109237,1291,"In recent weeks, Apple Inc. has accelerated plans to shift some of its production outside China, long the dominant country in the supply chain that built the world’s most valuable company, say people involved in the discussions. It is telling suppliers to plan more actively for assembling Apple products elsewhere in Asia, particularly India and Vietnam, they say, and looking to reduce dependence on Taiwanese assemblers led by Foxconn Technology Group. Turmoil at a place called iPhone City helped propel Apple’s shift. At the giant city-within-a-city in China, as many as 300,000 workers work at a factory run by Foxconn to make iPhones and other Apple products. At one point, it alone made about 85% of the Pro lineup of iPhones, according to market-research firm Counterpoint Research.

The Zhengzhou factory was convulsed in late November by violent protests. In videos posted online, workers upset about wages and Covid-19 restrictions could be seen throwing items and shouting “Stand up for your rights!"" Riot police were present, the videos show. The location of one of the videos was verified by the news agency and video-verification service Storyful. The Wall Street Journal corroborated events shown in the videos with workers at the site. Coming after a year of events that weakened China’s status as a stable manufacturing center, the upheaval means Apple no longer feels comfortable having so much of its business tied up in one place, according to analysts and people in the Apple supply chain.

“In the past, people didn’t pay attention to concentration risks,"" said Alan Yeung, a former U.S. executive for Foxconn. “Free trade was the norm and things were very predictable. Now we’ve entered a new world.""

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Monday as investors awaited more economic data ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting later this month.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 150 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off its second positive week in a row, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq advancing 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively. The Dow advanced 0.2% last week.
*****
&gt; In other news, Tesla shares slumped more than 4% on reports of an output cut at its Shanghai factory.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that smaller interest rate hikes could start in December. The Fed is slated to meet Dec. 13-14 and is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage points. On Friday, stronger-than-expected jobs report initially rattled markets, but traders later shook it off.
*****
&gt; Despite the recent rally, Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson said the risk-reward for equities has likely reached its cap as it nears the bank’s original tactical target range of 4,000 to 4,150.
*****
&gt; “As suggested two weeks ago, for this tactical rally to go higher, back end rates would need to fall,” he said in a note to clients Monday. “Fast forward to today and that’s what has happened. However, we are now right into our original upside targets and we recommend taking profits before the Bear returns in earnest.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors are expecting the November ISM services data at 10 a.m. ET on Monday. Economists polled by the Dow Jones expected a reading of 53.7.

1670308506,0,"Apple is home to some of the world's most coveted products, including the iPhone, Air Pods, the iPad, and its Mac lineup, to name a few. The high demand for its tech offerings drove the company to report revenue and operating income growth in its latest quarter despite significant declines in consumer spending throughout the industry. 

In Q4 2022, the iPhone manufacturer posted revenue of $90.15 billion, an 8.1% year-over-year rise and $1.38 billion more than previous analysts' forecasts.  Operating income increased 4.6% to $24.89 billion. 

Moreover, Apple has proven its position as one of the best growth stocks out there, with its shares rising 249% in the last five years despite a 19% dip in 2022. In fact, stock market star Warren Buffett has put 39.2% of **Berkshire Hathaway**'s portfolio into Apple stock, giving Berkshire a 5.8% stake in the company worth $135.3 billion.

With its long-term plans to venture into even newer areas, such as folding phones and electric vehicles, Apple will likely continue to see significant gains for years to come.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Monday’s rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Tuesday, as traders took a breather after fears of even higher rates sparked a sell-off during the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 20 points higher, or 0.06%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally higher.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite led Monday’s downward charge, dropping 1.93% for its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 9. The S&amp;P 500 shed 1.79%, also notching its worst day in nearly a month. The Dow, meanwhile, lost 482 points, or 1.4%.
*****
&gt; Better-than-expected November ISM Services data, which looks at the purchasing level of manufacturers as a gauge the health of the broader economy, pressured equities Monday. The report stoked fears that the Federal Reserve will need to hike rates for longer than anticipated to bring down inflation. The release aligns with the payrolls report late last week in pointing to resilience within some areas of the economy.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is largely expecting a 50 basis point increase to interest rates at the Fed’s December meeting, but remain conflicted over how long the central bank’s interest rate hiking campaign will need to last, especially given the latest data.
*****
&gt; Despite this backdrop, markets could still move higher in the months ahead, even though slowing growth and higher rates will persist even into the new year, wrote Jason Draho, UBS’ head of asset allocation, in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; “A year-end rally may still be in the offing, though investors are likely to remain skittish until November CPI is released on the 13th and the FOMC meeting concludes on the 14th,” he said. “If there are no surprises with these events, momentum could continue.”
*****
&gt; Investors will look ahead to data Tuesday morning on international trade for insight into the strength of the U.S. and global economy. Later in the day, they will watch for post-bell earnings reports from Smith &amp; Wesson and Stitch Fix.

1670524762,0,"The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends!

The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index.

Ignore Cnbc! They're in business to keep people watching. Yes, you can learn some things and get a general market sense, etc,but take everything you hear with a grain of salt!

Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesis,not to help YOU, but to make money for themselves. That's just my opinion.

Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but I'm slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing.

Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB.

Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc.

But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out, the ""bottom"" is NOW.

I mean by that that when you look back 5, 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a ""bottom"" compared to where they'll be in those.time frames.

So for the average investor seriously you're best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two, not a sector, but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly.

For example if you inest $100 A week, just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. You're not concerned with what happens next week, next month etc. You just keep buying!

So if you throw $50 into QQQ and it's  ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!

Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and don't eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. That's what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours.

So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions.

I also like to keep at least 30% cash right now, but maybe I should have more of that cash in low risk stocks like JNJ etc.

Anyways good luck all and remember that if you're under 40 you should just keep buying on autopilot into VTI or whatever. Don't woŕy about seeing RED in your portfolio.  You aren't concerned with what happens short term and RED means you now can buy either your index or favorite stocks for cheaper!!","bottom always outlook 20 years friends! best way make money long term keep buying small amounts week index. ignore cnbc! business keep people watching. yes, learn things get general market sense, etc,but take everything hear grain salt! remember people usually trying pump stocks get go along investing thesis,not help you, make money themselves. that's opinion. anyways 20 good companies average slowly coming around idea indexing larger portion dcaing. indexes like vti qqq qtec igv xlv ibb. mostly blue chips like unh msft aapl googl nvda lin unp cost asml lrcx etc. think average investor 10 20 year look out, ""bottom"" now. mean look back 5, 10 20 years indexes good companies ""bottom"" compared those.time frames. average investor seriously best bet successful long term pick index two, sector, broad index two like say vti qqq 50/50 weekly. example inest $100 week, put $50 vti qqq week get life. concerned happens next week, next month etc. keep buying! throw $50 qqq ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! thats buying opportunity!! always keep positive positive outlook life. keep fit healthy possible eat lot junk. try eat little can. that's now. fast every day least 12 hours. keep buying indexes. want mess individual stocks think keep 20% portfolio maybe 20 positions. also like keep least 30% cash right now, maybe cash low risk stocks like jnj etc. anyways good luck remember 40 keep buying autopilot vti whatever. woŕy seeing red portfolio. concerned happens short term red means buy either index favorite stocks cheaper!!","['Union Pacific', 'VTI', 'ASML Holding', 'UnitedHealth Group', 'QQQ', 'RED', 'NVIDIA', 'UNH MSFT', 'Linde plc', 'Costco Wholesale', 'Johnson & Johnson', 'JNJ', 'Apple', 'Alphabet', 'Microsoft']"

1670945313,5,"A 70-year-long effort to harness nuclear fusion reactions to generate unlimited clean energy is finally taking shape. For the first time in history, U.S. government scientists have generated more energy from a controlled reaction than it consumed.

The breakthrough was achieved at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last Tuesday after successfully simulating the solar reactions.

The net energy gain that the experiment achieved paves the way for an abundant supply of reliable, clean, and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel. If regularly achieved, net energy gains can curb climate change (if not reverse it in the very long term), oil sector-induced inflation can be tamed, and the world can eventually be weaned off its dependence on fossil fuels. (Deep dive: [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4b6f0fab-66ef-4e33-adec-cfc345589dc7))

# The stock angle

This has been an achievement decades in the making because nuclear fusion has the potential to create energy to power the world without producing carbon or radioactive waste. The road ahead will still be long before this technology becomes commercially viable, but for those in it for the long game, here's a look at how the breakthrough can benefit publicly traded companies like Chevron (**CVX**) and Amazon (**AMZN**). 

&gt;One of the world’s largest energy companies, Chevron, has made several significant investments in the area of clean energy. In this regard, the company started the Chevron Technology Ventures investment fund, which allocates its investments to several low-carbon energy resources. The fund presently has 10 investments in several innovative energy technologies.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The fund’s investment in Zap Energy, a company that is developing nuclear fusion-related technology, can provide Chevron’s investors significant exposure to this area. Moreover, its investment plans in expanding its hydrogen capabilities also speak of its commitment to improving clean energy.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Apart from its investments in clean energy, Chevron’s practical capital spending strategies and cost control measures can fuel solid long-term growth. Strong cash flow generating capability allows the company to up its oil production level, reduce its debt, and enhance shareholder value. Chevron is well-positioned to grow in the conventional oil and energy sector as much as it is when clean energy starts getting commercialized.

**Chevron is rated** [HOLD by 12/13 WSJ analysts](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CVX/research-ratings) **and consensus of Overweight**

&gt;At first glance, Amazon seems to be an unusual choice of stock when it comes to the process of nuclear fusion. However, diving deeper, technology is a very intricately interconnected marvel; and being one of the biggest tech giants, very few technological advancements can escape Amazon’s investments.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Companies dabbling in nuclear fusion directly are looking forward to creating functional reactors in the next few years. Although it’s likely that nuclear fusion technology commercialization won’t happen until the end of the decade, one of the industries that might be among the first to jump on the bandwagon is data centers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Data centers run on high amounts of power because of the sheer volume of data that forms the backbone of tech. For that reason, data centers are found in less-populated areas and already have the infrastructure to support new generators; thus ticking two important boxes for placing a nuclear reactor (the phrase “data is the new oil” now makes sense).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Now, Amazon already has billions invested in its AWS data centers and is continuing to expand its footprint in this market. In this case, it will not come as a surprise if Amazon, given its remarkable resources, adopts nuclear fusion technology to improve its cost efficiency and revenues.

**Amazon has a** [consensus rating of BUY](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN/research-ratings) **by WSJ analysts**

1670985601,1649,"The chorus of Tesla Inc. individual investors expressing misgivings that Chief Executive Elon Musk‘s involvement with Twitter Inc. may be to the detriment of the electric-vehicle maker is getting louder, with the car company’s stock on track for its worst full-year performance.  

“There is no TSLA CEO today,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday. 

Mr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla’s stock Monday. Shares in the world’s largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter, including the billionaire taking aim at the company’s former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.

Mr. Black said, “The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.”

Ross Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla’s board of directors. “Who is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,” Mr. Gerber said. 

He separately tweeted, “There is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon’s plans are.”

Mr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion. “I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,” he testified. 

Tesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday’s close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla’s stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.

Tesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world’s wealthiest individual, according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.

Mr. Musk’s takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla’s stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.

The Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: “Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides.” He later added “I will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,” but didn’t offer details.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. “I continue to oversee both Tesla &amp; SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,” he tweeted Saturday.

Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk’s purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company’s mission. Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn’t be the case.

Leo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: “Tesla board is missing in action” and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase. 

Mr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn’t signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year, including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter. 

Tesla’s brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult.

1670993331,37,"Hey everyone, I've spent several years trading volatile risky stocks and I've learned a few lessons along the way. I would like to share them here in case they may be useful to you.

Now before I begin, I want to make it clear that I'm not promoting any particular stock. Nor do I encourage anyone to trade risky volatile stocks. Your best bet is to consistently invest in a total market index fund like VTI and forget about it. If you must invest in individual stocks, invest in safe blue chip stocks like Apple or Amazon.

If you do invest in risky volatile stocks, realize that you can very well lose all your money. This isn't a joke or a game. Take it seriously. I'm sharing what I learned so you can hopefully minimize your risks and maximize your gains.

I don't own any BBBY shares now but I did own many of them earlier this year. In fact, I invested my entire life savings into BBBY shares. I bought at the right time, in late July-early August 2022. I ended up buying around 5000 BBBY shares and my total cost basis was $45,000. This represented my entire life savings as I don't have a 401k or IRA account. So you can imagine that I took on a fair amount of risk by investing my entire life savings in 1 stock. I did it because I wanted to swing trade and make a lot of money.

Now as you may be aware, BBBY share price went up by a lot in August 2022. On August 17th, my 5000 BBBY shares were worth $150,000. Yes, that's right. I had made $105,000 in unrealized gains. Unfortunately, like a greedy fool, I didn't sell. I wanted that $150,000 to reach $500,000 before I sold my BBBY shares. Yes, I was greedy and foolish and paid the price.

This brings me to my first lesson:

**Always take profit when you're in the green.**

You will never be able to time the top so don't even try. Remember, it's better to take some profit then to take none. If your unrealized gains is good enough for you to want to take a screenshot and send to your friends and family, then it's good enough for you to sell and realize those gains. Never forget that. Always sell when you're in the green. Don't be greedy and try to time the top so you can maximize gains.

My second lesson is:

**When you're in the green, at least sell enough shares so that you've covered your cost basis. That way, you're left playing with house money.**

This is a huge one. Cover your cost basis. If I had sold enough BBBY shares to cover my 45k cost basis, I would be in a much better financial situation now. Instead, I was greedy and decided to keep holding so I could make more gains. The best part of doing this is the relief you feel after your cost basis is covered. You know then that you're just playing with house money and even if you lose everything, it's ok because it's house money, not your initial money invested.

Like a naive greedy fool, I held on to my BBBY shares as the share price went down. I could have sold for a huge profit but I decided to keep holding. However, to my credit, I did sell all 5000 of my BBBY shares on Friday, September 2nd 2022 for $8.50 a share. In hindsight, that was a great decision because the BBBY share price kept slowly going down since then and the share price ended under $3 today, Tuesday, December 13th 2022. If I had kept holding those shares and not sold, I would have lost almost 30 thousand dollars.

This takes me to my third lesson:

**Be ready to exit your position, even at a loss, if you feel you will incur more losses by holding on to your position. It's better to take a small loss than a big loss.**

I really didn't want to sell my 5000 BBBY shares. I was hoping that the BBBY shares will go up in price like it did in August. However after analyzing the situation, I realized that the future didn't look bright for BBBY and it would be better I sold and took a $2500 loss rather than holding on to my shares and taking a much bigger loss. Looking back, I sure am glad I sold.

There was another reason why I sold and that's opportunity cost. After analyzing BBBY, I realized that even if the BBBY share price doesn't go down, it will most likely just stagnate and not make me any gains. It would be better to sell my BBBY shares and buy shares of a more promising stock which would make me more gains. That's what I did and it brings me to my fourth lesson:

**In addition to financial gain and losses, always consider opportunity costs and the value of your time. Even if a particular stock doesn't make you lose money, if it doesn't give you gains, then consider the opportunity cost. Consider what you're missing out on by tying your money into this particular stock that isn't taking you anywhere.**

The fifth lesson I learned is that even if your entry point to a particular stock isn't great i.e. you buy in at a high price and the share price subsequently drops, you can improve your cost basis by selling covered calls. This is especially useful for volatile stocks since they tend to have high implied volatility (IV) which usually means higher covered call premiums.

My fifth lesson is therefore:

**Consider selling covered calls to reduce your cost basis and generate some income, especially if you own a lot of shares of a particular stock.**

I'm not going to describe how to sell a covered call here because this post is long enough already but google and youtube will help you there.

Now I've been using BBBY as an example but these lessons are applicable to any risky volatile stock that you decide to trade with. I've traded several different risky stocks such as AMC, Palantir etc. in the past and the lessons I described above are applicable to all of them.

Anyway, that's it guys. I hope this is of some use to you. Please DM me if you have questions and I'll do my best to help. I know that none of the lessons I'm sharing are amazing secrets or anything like that. It's mostly common sense but many rookie traders forget to apply them. I wish someone had taught me these lessons before I started trading stocks which is why I made this post.","hey everyone, spent several years trading volatile risky stocks learned lessons along way. would like share case may useful you. begin, want make clear promoting particular stock. encourage anyone trade risky volatile stocks. best bet consistently invest total market index fund like vti forget it. must invest individual stocks, invest safe blue chip stocks like apple amazon. invest risky volatile stocks, realize well lose money. joke game. take seriously. sharing learned hopefully minimize risks maximize gains. bbby shares many earlier year. fact, invested entire life savings bbby shares. bought right time, late july-early august 2022. ended buying around 5000 bbby shares total cost basis $45,000. represented entire life savings 401k ira account. imagine took fair amount risk investing entire life savings 1 stock. wanted swing trade make lot money. may aware, bbby share price went lot august 2022. august 17th, 5000 bbby shares worth $150,000. yes, that's right. made $105,000 unrealized gains. unfortunately, like greedy fool, sell. wanted $150,000 reach $500,000 sold bbby shares. yes, greedy foolish paid price. brings first lesson: **always take profit green.** never able time top even try. remember, better take profit take none. unrealized gains good enough want take screenshot send friends family, good enough sell realize gains. never forget that. always sell green. greedy try time top maximize gains. second lesson is: **when green, least sell enough shares covered cost basis. way, left playing house money.** huge one. cover cost basis. sold enough bbby shares cover 45k cost basis, would much better financial situation now. instead, greedy decided keep holding could make gains. best part relief feel cost basis covered. know playing house money even lose everything, ok house money, initial money invested. like naive greedy fool, held bbby shares share price went down. could sold huge profit decided keep holding. however, credit, sell 5000 bbby shares friday, september 2nd 2022 $8.50 share. hindsight, great decision bbby share price kept slowly going since share price ended $3 today, tuesday, december 13th 2022. kept holding shares sold, would lost almost 30 thousand dollars. takes third lesson: **be ready exit position, even loss, feel incur losses holding position. better take small loss big loss.** really want sell 5000 bbby shares. hoping bbby shares go price like august. however analyzing situation, realized future look bright bbby would better sold took $2500 loss rather holding shares taking much bigger loss. looking back, sure glad sold. another reason sold that's opportunity cost. analyzing bbby, realized even bbby share price go down, likely stagnate make gains. would better sell bbby shares buy shares promising stock would make gains. that's brings fourth lesson: **in addition financial gain losses, always consider opportunity costs value time. even particular stock make lose money, give gains, consider opportunity cost. consider missing tying money particular stock taking anywhere.** fifth lesson learned even entry point particular stock great i.e. buy high price share price subsequently drops, improve cost basis selling covered calls. especially useful volatile stocks since tend high implied volatility (iv) usually means higher covered call premiums. fifth lesson therefore: **consider selling covered calls reduce cost basis generate income, especially lot shares particular stock.** going describe sell covered call post long enough already google youtube help there. using bbby example lessons applicable risky volatile stock decide trade with. traded several different risky stocks amc, palantir etc. past lessons described applicable them. anyway, that's guys. hope use you. please dm questions best help. know none lessons sharing amazing secrets anything like that. mostly common sense many rookie traders forget apply them. wish someone taught lessons started trading stocks made post.","['VTI', 'Amazon', 'AMC', 'Apple', 'BBBY']"

# [Stock futures are muted as investors await the Federal Reserve’s rate decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hike decision in its effort to crush inflation.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 2 points, or less than 0.1%. Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also roughly flat.
*****
&gt; The Fed will conclude its December meeting and is expected to deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike. That’s a smaller bump after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes. A basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent.
*****
&gt; Chair Jerome Powell will also speak Wednesday, giving further clues about what’s coming from the Fed in 2023. In previous meetings this year, traders have been sensitive to Powell’s language, interpreting his tone as hawkish or dovish.
*****
&gt; “While we expect the Fed to slow the pace of rate rises at its Wednesday meeting, policymakers are likely to stress that the job of curbing inflation is not yet over,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Wednesday note. “A slowing of job creation and wage growth will be needed before the Fed can stop hiking.”
*****
&gt; Stocks rose for a second day Tuesday, fueled by a cooler-than-anticipated inflation report. The November consumer price index was 7.1% on the year, less than the 7.3% gain expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The 0.1% increase from the previous month was also less than forecast.
*****
&gt; The signal that inflation may have peaked was positive for stocks as it means the Fed may be one step closer to halting interest rate hikes or switching to cuts, which would fuel equities.

Both of these companies are backed by governments.  Is China (or their uber rich) really going to let NIO go bankrupt?  Is the Saudi Sovern Wealth fund that has backed LCID really going to let them go bust?  

Does it seem reasonable that some ""big announcement"" is pending that would ultimately have these companies become major auto makers?

# [Stock futures fall a second day on fears the Fed will tip the economy into a recession](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were sharply lower Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy update, as investors worried the central bank could tip the economy into a recession as it continues its fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 350 points, or 1.05%. S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.59%.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his stake in the company.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields declined following the most recent Fed rate hike, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling below 3.5%.
*****
&gt; Those moves follow a down session Wednesday when the Dow fell 142 points, while the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76%.
*****
&gt; Investors digested the Federal Reserve’s latest comments following a boost to its overnight borrowing rate. The central bank said it will continue hiking rates through 2023 and projected a higher-than-expected terminal rate of 5.1%. With Wednesday’s half a percentage point hike, the targeted range for rates is currently 4.25% to 4.5%, which is the highest in 15 years.
*****
&gt; “Overall, we expected to hear Chair Powell emphasize that the ‘hard part’ of returning inflation to 2.0% is just beginning. We largely received that message,” Bank of America’s Michael Gapen wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
&gt; “The Fed remains willing to risk a recession in the labor market in order to bring inflation down and, if anything, the December projections suggest that risk has risen, not diminished. We agree and continue to look for a recession in 1H 2023 and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate than the median FOMC member projects,” Gapen added.
*****
&gt; Despite favorable improvements like modest growth, spending and production, Powell indicated he remains concerned job gains are too robust and the unemployment rate is too good for the Fed’s fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Investors will get another batch of economic data to digest Thursday. Retail sales, jobless claims and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index are all due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

1671120995,327," 

**Tesla** ([**TSLA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) investors are growing tired of Elon Musk's Twitter fiasco. And for good reason.

The 10 largest investors in the electric-vehicle maker's stock, including ETF giants Vanguard, **BlackRock** ([**BLK**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and [**Musk himself**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/elon-musk-sp500-lost-this-staggering-amount-on-tesla-stock/), lost nearly $133 billion since Twitter's board accepted Musk's buyout on April 25, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and [**MarketSmith**](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).

It cost Musk the position as the richest person in the world. But he's not alone feeling the pain.

## Tesla Stock Dropping Like A Rock

Tesla's value is down more than 52% since the Twitter buyout was approved on April 25, while the S&amp;P 500 is only off 5.5%. And Tesla stock is off 29% since the deal closed on Oct. 27, much worse than the S&amp;P 500's 6.6% gain in that time. Shares are down again Wednesday, by 3.4% to 155.38.

That's shredding a jaw-dropping amount of wealth for Tesla investors. The value of Tesla is down $339 billion from the Twitter deal's approval and $206 billion from the close.

Investors worry that Musk is so infatuated with Twitter, he's not minding Tesla.

Investors owning shares of Tesla, now down more than 50% this year, are vocally expressing displeasure. ""There is no TSLA CEO today,"" Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, which is down nearly $18 million on its Tesla stock since April, tweeted Monday, as [**first reported by the Wall Street Journal**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7).

## It's Not Just Costing Elon Musk

Musk is definitely [**suffering the most from the Tesla implosion**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-burned-as-musk-goes-ballistic-on-twitter/). As the largest shareholder with 14.1% of the company, he's personally lost $47.9 billion from the time the Twitter deal closed.

But losses are spreading to Main Street, too, as the giant ETF and mutual fund companies are the next biggest owners. Vanguard, which is [**forecasting a recession**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-vanguard-predicts-global-recession-next-year-why-to-believe/) next year, is the No. 2 largest holder of Tesla stock.

*****
&gt; Stocks dropped Friday, building on their year-end sell-off, as fears grow over a recession taking place as the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281.76 points, or 0.85%, to 32,920.46. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.11% to 3,852.36. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.97% to 10,705.41.
*****
&gt; The indexes notched a second consecutive week of losses. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.08% for the week, and putting its December losses at 5.58%, as hopes for a year-end rally fizzle. The Dow and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Trading was especially volatile Friday with a large amount of options expiring. There were $2.6 trillion worth of index options expiring, the highest amount “relative to the size of the equity market in nearly two years,” according to Goldman Sachs. At session lows, the Dow was down as much as 547.63 points, before paring back some of those losses.
*****
&gt; The sell-off was broad-based, with three stocks falling for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, there were only 10 S&amp;P 500 names in positive territory. The real estate and consumer discretionary sectors were the biggest laggards, down nearly 3% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell this week in the wake of the Fed’s 50 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday — the highest rate in 15 years. The central bank said it would continue hiking rates through 2023 to 5.1%, a larger figure than previously expected.
*****
&gt; Following the policy update, the Dow dropped 142 points on Wednesday, plunged 764 points Thursday, and declined further on Friday.
*****
&gt; “At the beginning of the week, we had the hope, given the very soft CPI number, that we could expect the Fed, and maybe the other central banks of the world, to be less hawkish,” Bokeh Capital founder Kim Forrest said.
*****
&gt; “But because they didn’t, and they had some stern words for investors and consumers alike that they were really focused on getting inflation down quickly, that has taken away a lot of our hope for a soft landing,” Forrest added.

&gt; # Santa Claus Rally, Mid-December Low &amp; January Indicator Trifecta

&gt; Wall Street, MSM and social are abuzz with Santa Claus Rally chatter and hype this week, but everyone has it all wrong. I can see Yale’s big grin shining down on us as his famous indicator and catchphrase reverberate on The Street.

&gt; They argue their case for why the “Santa Claus Rally” will or won’t come to town this year. But they miss the point. Yale Hirsch invented and named the Santa Claus Rally in 1972, published in the 1973 Almanac. Oh lord, it is still misunderstood. It’s not a trading strategy, it’s an indicator!

&gt; SCR is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3%. Failure to rally tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year.

&gt; To wit Yale’s famous line: “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come To Broad And Wall.” (Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023 p 118).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c6285b39d656e4d47a2825774f0ebca7/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-a9/s500x750/c2684ec719407200da72d1e590a56cbc11015917.jpg))**

&gt; The current situation is reminiscent of 1974. Midterm October low, December retest. Lots of dire news and conditions. The Fed is clearly done taking orders from Wall Street and Washington and is bent on halting inflation. Their quarterly dot plot ticked up and it looks like at least one more 50bps hike. It’s working, inflation is decelerating. Reality is we will have higher inflation and rates for a while.

&gt; But we have already been in a bear and likely a recession. Bear markets bottom before recessions end and bull markets start when The Street least expects and practically everyone is a bear right now. While it sure looks ugly out there, we contend the worst is behind and a nascent bull is trying to emerge.

&gt; Stocks tend to bottom here in mid-December ahead of the seasonally strong last half of the month, especially small caps – what used to be the “January Effect.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/abe551038af905961dbe224f3309291b/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-dd/s500x750/bf884d42dce190a9e6386a7bab4025a8131b2f8d.jpg))**

&gt; The results of the Santa Claus Rally along with the other two components of our “January Indicator Trifecta,” the first five days of January and the full month January Barometer (also created by Yale Hirsch in 1972) will help solidify our outlook for next year.

&gt; When all three are up the S&amp;P 500 has been up 90% of the time, 28 of 31 years, with an average gain of 17.5%. When any of them are down the year’s results are reduced and when all three are down the S&amp;P was down 3 of 8 years with an average loss of -3.6% with bear markets in 1969 (-11.4%), 2000 (-10.1%) and 2008 (-38.5%), flat years in 1956 (2.6%), 1978 (1.1%) and 2005 (3.0%). Down Trifecta’s were followed by gains in 1982 (14.8%) and 2016 (9.5%).

&gt; Keep your eye on the SCR for signs of a new bull or continuing bear. Then watch for the rest of our “January Indicator Trifecta” FFD and JB. When all 3 agree the market generally follows suit.

&gt; We are anticipating a SCR this year. Inflation is easing, the Fed is likely to be done with rate increases in Q1 and we also see supply chain constraints fading now that China is loosening its Covid-19 restrictions. Seasonally speaking, we are also in the middle of the historically strongest period for stocks, the “Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle,” Q4 of midterm years through Q2 of pre-election year.

&gt; # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

&gt; “I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” Abraham Lincoln

&gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

&gt; First things first, we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023, which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here.

&gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market, we are using the traditional definition, which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes, there isn’t much difference between 19.8% and 20.0%, so we will also include some near bear markets as well, but when we say bear market, that is what we mean.

&gt; First, do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they don’t, as stocks, indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987, which all took place without a recession.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-197-800x595.png))**

&gt; Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‘near bear markets’ this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

&gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn’t have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

&gt; Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don’t end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don’t see a recession, so this wouldn’t be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

&gt; Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there’s a very good chance number seven just happened.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

&gt; Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

&gt; Dr. Seuss said, “Sometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.” To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

&gt; # 2022 US Stock Market Snapshot

&gt; With just a couple more weeks left in the year, the S&amp;P is down 18.2% year-to-date, which is tracking for the worst year since the Financial Crisis in 2008. As shown below, we've seen huge monthly volatility throughout the year within an overall downtrend. If December's declines hold, we'll have seen a move of 3% or more in either direction in eleven of twelve months this year. September has (so far) been the worst month with a decline of 9.3%, while July was the best month with a gain of 9.1%. In terms of weekday performance, Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays have averaged declines this year, while Tuesdays and Wednesdays have averaged small gains.

&gt; # Energy Losing Its Grip

&gt; You know those scenes in the movies where a character finds themselves hanging off a bridge, and slowly their sweaty grip starts to loosen as a finger or two starts to slip? That's what the energy sector is going through right now. As oil prices have been under pressure over the last few months, energy stocks had been holding up relatively well as the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector hit a new cycle high exactly a month ago today. Since then, the sector has declined nearly 9% even as the S&amp;P 500 has moved higher. Last week, the sector broke below its 50-DMA for the first time in over two months before stabilizing this week. Since that break below the 50-DMA on 12/6, the sector has made multiple intraday attempts (including today) to get back above it, but each time the sector has sold off and finished off its intraday highs. When looking at a price chart, any time you see a security break below a key moving average and then make several unsuccessful attempts to get back above that level, it's often a sign of a momentum shift.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/121422-XLE.png))**

&gt; On a relative strength basis, the Energy sector is also toeing a key trendline. The chart below compares the relative strength of XLE to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) over the last year. During that time, Energy's relative strength has been riding a trendline higher with bounces each time it kissed that level. The most recent example occurred this week, but at this point, the bounce has been meager. Energy stocks have been outperforming energy commodities in recent months, so it's only natural to see some mean reversion in the stocks as well, but with the sector already breaking below its 50-DMA, this is a key trendline to watch. If the sector's relative strength weakens further, the technical picture for the sector would weaken materially, which would be a development investors in just about every other sector wouldn't shed a tear for.

&gt; # The Monetary Policy Conversation is Going to Shift in 2023

&gt; First, the good news –

&gt; * The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points (bps) to the 4.25-4.50% range – a step down from the 75 bps rate hike pace they went with at the last four meetings. This was expected, but it’s always good to see confirmation.
&gt; * They also said that “ongoing rate increases will be necessary” and raised their estimate of the peak rate from 4.6% to 5.1% in 2023, which was not a big surprise. What’s important is that the end of the rate hike cycle is near. The estimate revisions are nowhere as large as what we had seen earlier this year. At the end of 2021, they estimated rates to peak at 2.1% and then continuously shifted those up by 0.6% – 1% increments every three months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-median-fed-funds-rate-expectation-600x800.png))**

&gt; The not-so-good news: They also provided revised estimates for the economy, which wasn’t great.

&gt; * They revised economic growth lower, from 1.2% to 0.5% (2023)
&gt; * They revised the unemployment rate higher, from 4.4% to 4.6% (about 1% point higher than where it is now)
&gt; * They revised core inflation higher, from 3.1% to 3.5% (2023)

&gt; While Fed Chair Powell was careful to say that they don’t believe these forecasts qualify as a recession, keep in mind that the U.S. has never experienced a 1% rise in the unemployment rate outside of a recession.

&gt; But if you notice, I said “not so good news” instead of “bad news.” Powell pointed out that these are members’ best estimates “as of today,” but that could change as new data comes in. And we have plenty of data coming in. Before their March meeting (when they update the projections again), we have three more inflation reports, three employment reports, and an employment cost index report (which is a preferred gauge of wage growth).

&gt; If you look back at the previous chart, we’ve seen significant shifts in rate expectations just over the course of this year. There’s no reason to think we won’t see more revisions if the data cooperates.

&gt; # The shift: From how fast and how high to how long
&gt; The conversation in 2022 revolved around inflation, which surged to the highest level since 1981. As a result, we saw the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in four decades as the Federal Reserve (Fed) looked to get on top of inflation. The Fed’s singular focus was to ensure they did more than “enough” to lower inflation. Consequently, the over-arching question on investors’ minds across the year was how quickly the Fed would raise rates, and how high they would go.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-fed-funds-target-rate-601x800.png))**

&gt; I believe that’s going to shift in 2023. Fed officials will likely start thinking about balance again: the risk of tightening too much vs. the risk of not doing enough. Powell mentioned this in comments he made a couple of weeks ago but didn’t mention it again in his post-FOMC meeting press conference. The omission was curious, more so because we just got a second consecutive inflation report that surprised us to the downside. All he said was that, while the report was encouraging, they need substantially more evidence to believe that inflation has turned a corner. And so, they’ll keep rates “sufficiently restrictive.”

&gt; I think it was probably more a matter of Fed officials not having enough time to digest the report and not revising estimates accordingly. But as I wrote, the prospects of softer inflation in 2023 look good. There is enough reason to believe that disinflation will kick in as we get into the backend of 2023, especially if energy prices don’t spike again and core goods prices continue to ease. Official rental inflation starts to reflect market rents (which are falling rapidly). All of which makes it likely that estimate revisions will happen.

&gt; So, the question for investors will also shift—from how fast and how high to how long and how long they will keep interest rates at an overly restrictive level. The conversation will revolve around how many months of soft inflation data they need to see and how soft it must be. This could obviously take some time since inflation is not going to go down in a straight line – there may be fits and starts and false alarms, but the trend is clear.

&gt; # The risk of “transitory” deflation
&gt; What will upset the apple cart is that the disinflation we see in goods prices and housing is deemed transitory by the Fed, and they maintain rates at an overly tight level. This is not an insignificant risk. Powell again mentioned core services inflation, excluding housing in his press conference. He tied it to wage growth and a tight labor market. This group includes personal care services, education, childcare costs, wireless services, insurance fees, etc. – all captured in the light blue bar in the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-15-core-CPI-576x800.png))**

&gt; As you can see, the good news is that the light blue bar just made its lowest contribution to core inflation in four months. The risk is that the Fed looks past all of this. Instead, they use wage growth and other labor market metrics as their guiding light as they think about “how long to stay restrictive.”

&gt; I think the odds are weighted in favor of them moving lower once inflation starts to fall rapidly, though only by the end of 2023 at the earliest. Which is not as early and not as big cuts as the market currently expects.

&gt; # Is Anyone Bullish?

&gt; “The future ain’t what it used to be.” Yogi Berra

&gt; We’ve noticed a recent trend: nearly no one is looking for stocks to do much in 2023. As Yogi said many years ago, the future ain’t looking too good.

&gt; The general consensus is that the first half of next year could be very rough, with many banks and investment shops expecting stocks to go back to new lows. Here’s a tweet I did summarizing some of the recent calls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-195-800x364.png))**

&gt; Adding to this, for one of the first times ever, Bloomberg data showed that Wall Street Strategists expect negative returns for the S&amp;P 500 next year. That just doesn’t happen, or it didn’t happen until now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-275.jpg))**

&gt; We’ve also noticed a considerable spike in put volume over the past week, another way of showing how potentially worried the masses are currently. Then yesterday, I saw this headline, adding to the festive mood.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-361-800x228.png))**

&gt; Here are two more signs of near-historic levels of skepticism. First, the recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey showed a record low level of risk appetite. In other words, lower than the financial crisis and COVID.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-410.png))**

&gt; Second, our friends at TDAmeritrade have proprietary data showing retail investors near the lowest level of sentiment since April 2020. This is called the Investor Movement Index (IMX), which measures what investors are actually doing and how they are positioning in markets. Again, not a lot of excitement out there.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-581-800x523.png))**

&gt; There’s an old Wall Street adage that it is hard to get hurt falling out of a basement window, and we think that could be the case now. Our take is that an incredible amount of negativity is priced into markets currently, and any good news could continue the recent strength off the October lows. Or, as General Patton said, “If everyone is thinking alike, somebody isn’t thinking.”

&gt; What could spark it? It’ll likely be better trends in inflation, which could open the door for the Fed to turn slightly more dovish. Coupled with what we continue to believe is a healthy and robust consumer, the economy may likely avoid the recession that many are expecting. We discussed better trends in inflation here and here.

&gt; It is hard for us not to keep pointing out that it is extremely rare for stocks to fall two years in a row. The S&amp;P 500 was down two years in a row in ’73 and ’74 (one of the worst recessions ever), then three years after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s, that’s it. Even during the financial crisis, stocks only fell in 2008 before a significant rebound in 2009.

&gt; As the table below shows, it pays not to drive the car looking at the rearview mirror, as what just happened likely won’t happen again. As every time stocks fell in a midterm year (likely where we land in 2022), they bounced back the following year each time and gained 25% on average. Now, to be clear, we aren’t saying stocks will gain 25% next year… But we are saying it isn’t as crazy as it sounds.

&gt; Warren Buffett said, “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.” Things haven’t been good for investors this year, but there are many opportunities to plant some trees today and benefit from what we predict to be a surprisingly good year for investors in 2023.

&gt; # VIX Death Cross Historically Bullish for S&amp;P 500 over Next 2 Weeks

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/701d12ab931a8e09d896aca1743b79b8/45d979a75554c1bd-aa/s500x750/84cf1e777c0891ca4ee5224dedf9b08cf23f5650.jpg))**

&gt; On Friday December 9, a Death Cross appeared on a chart of CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). A Death Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. When this happens to an individual stock or major index like S&amp;P 500 it is normally considered bearish. But since the VIX is designed to measure near-term market volatility the lower it goes the better the S&amp;P 500 usually performs. Thus, a VIX Death Cross can be a bullish indication.

&gt; Going back to 1990, including the most recent cross, there have been 36 VIX Death Crosses. The S&amp;P 500’s average performance 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the past 35 VIX Death Crosses have been plotted in the following chart. In the 30 trading days prior to the VIX Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 rose an average of 4.1%. This solid advance is what played a large role in the VIX Death Cross as a rising market is normally accompanied by falling volatility and a declining VIX. After the Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 continued to climb another 2.5% over the next 60 trading days.

&gt; Also included on the chart are the 35 VIX Golden Crosses. A Golden Cross is just the opposite of a Death Cross, the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average as VIX is rising. A VIX Golden Cross is not a good event for S&amp;P 500 as it has typically declined an average 2.4% before the VIX Golden Cross and failed to return to breakeven 60 trading days later.

&gt; In following tables, we present the S&amp;P 500 performance after past VIX Death Crosses and VIX Golden Crosses across various timeframes. Based upon average performance the near-term, 1-and 2-week S&amp;P 500 performance following a VIX Death Cross is better than a VIX Golden Cross, but by 1-month later and beyond the results are less clear. This would suggest that the current VIX Death Cross is likely bullish in the near-term, but not a great indication much beyond 2-weeks.

1671247290,21,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don’t trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let’s look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors: 

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid. 

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was “due to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.” One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher. 

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith’s Owner’s Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it’s hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.”

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

· **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

· **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon’s advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are. 

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&amp;Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you’re going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

1671313020,511,"Virtual Reality Pioneer Is Leaving Meta

John Carmack, who was chief technology officer of Oculus, which Meta bought, is departing the company.

John Carmack, a pioneer of virtual reality technology, is leaving Meta after more than eight years at the company, according to an internal post reviewed by The New York Times.

In the post, which was written by Mr. Carmack, 52, the technologist criticized his employer. He said Meta, which is in the midst of transitioning from a social networking company to one focused on the immersive world of the metaverse, was operating at “half the effectiveness” and has “a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort.”

“It has been a struggle for me,” Mr. Carmack wrote in the post, which was published on an internal forum this week. “I have a voice at the highest levels here, so it feels like I should be able to move things, but I’m evidently not persuasive enough.”

As the former chief technology officer of Oculus, the virtual reality company that Facebook bought for $2 billion in 2014, Mr. Carmack was one of the most influential voices leading the development of V.R. headsets. He stayed with Facebook after Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, decided to shift the company last year to focus on the metaverse and renamed Facebook as Meta.

Yet even though Meta was moving swiftly into an area that Mr. Carmack specialized in, he was sometimes a dissenting voice about how the effort was going. He became known for internal posts that criticized the decision-making and direction set forth by Mr. Zuckerberg and Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer. Mr. Carmack had been working part-time for the company in recent years.

What Is the Metaverse, and Why Does It Matter?


The origins. The word “metaverse” describes a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the one in which we live. It was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel “Snow Crash,” and the concept was further explored by Ernest Cline in his novel “Ready Player One.”

The future. Many people in tech believe the metaverse will herald an era in which our virtual lives will play as important a role as our physical realities. Some experts warn that it could still turn out to be a fad or even dangerous.

Mr. Carmack and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. Insider earlier reported on Mr. Carmack’s departure.

Meta’s earnings have been hit hard by its spending on the metaverse and its slowing growth in social networking and digital advertising. In July, the Silicon Valley company posted its first sales decline as a public company. Last month, Meta said it was laying off about 11,000 employees, or about 13 percent of its work force, in what amounted to the company’s most significant job cuts.

In a podcast interview in August, Mr. Carmack said Meta’s $10 billion loss at the time in the division housing its augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives made him “sick to my stomach.” He added that the company’s metaverse efforts have been hampered by bureaucracy and dogged by concerns about diversity and privacy.

In other posts seen by The Times from this year, Mr. Carmack criticized features on the company’s Quest virtual reality headsets. In his farewell post, he commended the Quest 2 headset as “almost exactly what I wanted to see from the beginning” in terms of its cost and mobile hardware, though he was still critical of its software.

“We built something pretty close to The Right Thing,” he said.

Mr. Carmack’s post, which said he was ending his decade in V.R., concluded by saying he had “wearied of the fight” and would focus on his own start-up. (He announced in August that his artificial intelligence firm, Keen Technologies, had raised $20 million.)

“V.R. can bring value to most of the people in the world, and no company is better positioned to do it than Meta,” he wrote.

Before Meta, Mr. Carmack pioneered various techniques in computer graphics that became crucial to games that he developed, including Quake. He joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer and stepped down from that role in 2019, moving into a part-time role.

Mr. Carmack this week also testified in a court hearing over the Federal Trade Commission’s attempt to block Meta’s purchase of Within, the virtual reality start-up behind a fitness game called Supernatural. The agency has argued that the tech giant will snuff out competition in the nascent metaverse if it is allowed to complete the deal. The hearing is expected to continue next week.","virtual reality pioneer leaving meta john carmack, chief technology officer oculus, meta bought, departing company. john carmack, pioneer virtual reality technology, leaving meta eight years company, according internal post reviewed new york times. post, written mr. carmack, 52, technologist criticized employer. said meta, midst transitioning social networking company one focused immersive world metaverse, operating “half effectiveness” “a ridiculous amount people resources, constantly self-sabotage squander effort.” “it struggle me,” mr. carmack wrote post, published internal forum week. “i voice highest levels here, feels like able move things, i’m evidently persuasive enough.” former chief technology officer oculus, virtual reality company facebook bought $2 billion 2014, mr. carmack one influential voices leading development v.r. headsets. stayed facebook mark zuckerberg, chief executive, decided shift company last year focus metaverse renamed facebook meta. yet even though meta moving swiftly area mr. carmack specialized in, sometimes dissenting voice effort going. became known internal posts criticized decision-making direction set forth mr. zuckerberg andrew bosworth, meta’s chief technology officer. mr. carmack working part-time company recent years. metaverse, matter? origins. word “metaverse” describes fully realized digital world exists beyond one live. coined neal stephenson 1992 novel “snow crash,” concept explored ernest cline novel “ready player one.” future. many people tech believe metaverse herald era virtual lives play important role physical realities. experts warn could still turn fad even dangerous. mr. carmack meta respond requests comment. insider earlier reported mr. carmack’s departure. meta’s earnings hit hard spending metaverse slowing growth social networking digital advertising. july, silicon valley company posted first sales decline public company. last month, meta said laying 11,000 employees, 13 percent work force, amounted company’s significant job cuts. podcast interview august, mr. carmack said meta’s $10 billion loss time division housing augmented reality virtual reality initiatives made “sick stomach.” added company’s metaverse efforts hampered bureaucracy dogged concerns diversity privacy. posts seen times year, mr. carmack criticized features company’s quest virtual reality headsets. farewell post, commended quest 2 headset “almost exactly wanted see beginning” terms cost mobile hardware, though still critical software. “we built something pretty close right thing,” said. mr. carmack’s post, said ending decade v.r., concluded saying “wearied fight” would focus start-up.

# Verisign (VRSN)

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ VRSN operates 2 of the 13 world’s root servers. Root servers track IP Address with the domain names associated with that IP address. VRSN has been granted a monopoly for .com and .net registrations.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Recurring. Each year domains must pay to keep their domain associated with its IP address so it can be connected to the internet. These prices are set through ICANN. The current agreement runs through October 2026 and at that point VRSN is allowed to raise prices up 10.26. In January 2020 the price was $7.85. This implies an annual price increase of 4% per year. 

§ Revenue is influenced by 3 factors: New registrations, Retention Rates and pricing.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Yes, VRSN leverages its monopolistic position with a high amount of debt. Currently they operate with more debt than they have assets (negative equity). Having said that their interest coverage is a very reasonable 12x given the steadiness in revenue. While negative equity can indicate a company is insolvent, negative equity here showcases their ability to distribute significant wealth to its shareholders through stock buybacks.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, as of their 3Q report they have a credit line outstanding $200 million with none drawn on it. That represents about a quarter and a half of expenses. Given the low customer concentration, the mission critical nature of their service and the nominal cost for businesses, I am comfortable with this LOC. 

§ Additionally, they operate with a negative cash conversion cycle (take in cash before expenses occur).

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ VRSN has been the backbone of the internet for over 25 years and has contracts in place to 2026. The internet works extremely well, and its fees are nominal. To me this translates into a cemented position. Would it be worth it for a regulator to entertain a competitor that is willing to charge $9 or $8 given things work extremely well? Probably not.

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes VRSN’s financials are the envy of virtually any firm. Their average ROA over the past 5 years is a massive 34% with average FCF margins are 60% over the past 5 years and they have virtually no CAPEX.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ Regulatory Entrenchment. They have smoothly operated as the backbone of the internet for over 25 years. This gives VRSN a unique understanding of the internet’s operations as they are the only player in the space. I feel that it would not be worth the risk for a regulator to move to a different provider.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No. Capital is not the issue for this business. Any company could match IP with domain names. What matters here is relationships to get the contract as well as history of strong services, which they have.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ Yes what they actually do is extremely easy, but it is only available to one player. 

o Are their competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, they potentially could be bypassed from blockchains. Blockchain operates outside the DNS system which is used to match IP addresses with domain names. Should the world move on the blockchain, and we start navigating to Google.eth rather than .com or .net they would be cutout as their service would not be needed. This has a minor potential at this point, but is something important to watch for sure.

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, revenue has grown literally every quarter over at least the last decade with margins pretty steady at 60% over nearly all TTM periods.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Probably not. Over the last 5 years revenue gains have averaged at 3.1% per year despite a covid bump

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? 

§ I feel I do.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Yes, although growth will be somewhat a challenge

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ They do not pay a dividend.

§ Free cash flow Yields have averaged 3.7% over the past 5 years.

§ Revenue 3 years from now is estimated to be $1.78 billion.

§ With an average FCF margin of 60% over the past 5 years, I believe margin will hold around that level meaning FCF is expected to be $1.068 billion.

§ Over the last 4.25 years shares have been reduced by about 4.25% per year. During this period of buybacks FCF yields ranged between 2.7% and 4.2%. Given that FCF yield is at the higher end of the range I would say they could easily retire 4.2% per year going forward. I will model share buybacks at 3.75% to 4.25% per year

§ Shares Outstanding as of 10/21/22 are 106,016,456. 12/31/25 would be 3.08 years away. This implies shares outstanding 3.08 years from now at 92.74 million and 94.24 million

§ This means forecasted FCF per share is estimated to be between $11.31 and $11.51.

§ If we assume a FCF Yield between 3.5% to 4.5% this implies a Dec 2025 price of $251 to $328.

§ With a current price of $200 this implies a 3-year CAGR between 8.01% to 17.93%

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ Given the historical steadiness of the company and contract through 2026 along with the low-end expectations of an 8.0% annualized return, I feel that this company represents good value at this time given what I feel is a cemented competitive position.

Revenue:

Revenue mainly comes from Advertising, Cloud and Others and can be reliably forecasted. For simplicity sake, the first paragraph of each year will be %of revenue from Advertising, Cloud and Others. Second paragraph of each year will be Y/Y growth from Advertising, Cloud and Others.

**Cloud:**  
**2022:**  
% forecast: Due to covid, businesses were pushed to go digital so firms are more receptive to automation so Cloud is likely to take up a larger portion of revenue over time.  


Y/Y forecast: The average of 2020 - 2021 is taken when forecasting Y/Y cloud 2022 as these took into account the effects of covid, however a limitation recognised here would be that in 2022 high inflation led to high interest rates so Y/Y growth may not be so high.  


**2023 - 2024:**  
**%** forecast: I forecast that cloud will start taking up a larger percentage of revenue as the Fed do expect interest rates to come down by end of 2024 when interest rates fall businesses are likely to be able to invest in the business and automate.

Y/Y forecast: Due to a lack of industry knowledge I’m going to be conservative and assume a slightly higher than historic growth rate of 2% Y/Y per year from 2023 to 2024.

**2025 - 2026:%** forecast: I estimate cloud will probably peak at about 15% due to tougher competitions from AWS and market saturation.

Y/Y forecast: Due to the full effects of falling interest rates finally showing up due to the lag in policy in 2025, Y/Y increase is going to spike higher than past forecasted years.

**2027 - 2030:%** forecast: I estimate that cloud will probably plateau at about 13.5% onwards.

Y/Y forecast:  Revenue is plateaued to 47% as a conservative estimate

**Advertising:**

**2022:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in terms of % of revenue due to decrease in retail spending and tougher inflation environment.

Y/Y forecast: To prevent Y/Y growth from being skewed by 2020 Covid, I only took the average of 2018-2019 where advertisers had the confidence of spending on advertisement without taking covid into consideration.

**2023 - 2025:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in 2023 and 2024 due to high interest rates and uncertain environment for investors. A conservative 1% was used in decline as advertising is still GOOG’s core operations.

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is assumed to be more conservative as advertising is a matured business of GOOG. But 2025 Y/Y growth will be higher due to lower interest rates.

**2026 - 2030:**% forecast: GOOG is likely to continue being a strong seller of advertisements and their expansion into different modal for google searches is likely to keep their advertisement revenue high.Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is harder to forecast due to uncertainty in interest rates policy from 2025 onwards.**Others:**% forecast: I’m uncertain of how exactly to accurately depict others but it is not something that GOOG focuses on especially when you listen to their past few earnings calls. So % I’ll just use others to top up till 100%

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth I’ll assume plateaus at about 18% due to strong competition from Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

**EBIT:**

The average of 2020 and 2021 were taken when forecasting 2022 as 2020 was when there were high layoffs due to covid uncertainty and 2021 was when there was low interest rates that allowed companies to reinvest more than usual.

GOOG is still reinvesting large sums back into cloud so EBIT is taken to decrease till 23% with reference to 2018 and 2019 where it seemed like a steady margin and the most efficiently run GOOG was.To be conservative I’ll just assume EBIT goes to 20% by the end of my forecast period.

**Taxes:**

Due to GOOG being high in R&amp;D I’d assume Taxes hold steady at 20% throughout my forecast.

**D&amp;A:**

Assumed to be at 7% throughout

**Deferred Taxes:**

Being a relatively small line item, I assume that deferred taxes are going to get smaller as GOOG would probably know how to value their PP&amp;E properly as more time goes on. But since it is a small line item, I just put it at a constant 1% to avoid over or undercompensating for it,

**Change in NWC:**

Assumed to be at 1% throughout

**CapEX:**

I assume GOOG is going to ramp up CapEX going into 2025 due to interest rates expected to be lowered by then. But over time as Cloud becomes matured I don’t see CapEX taking up a large portion so I tend it towards 10% just above D&amp;A

**WACC:**

COE, GOOG does not pay dividend yield so most of COE comes from average % price increase in its stock.I’d assume GOOG has a market beta of the average between 1.25 and 1.06  based on [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/Betas.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html) GOOG is classified under information services? And [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)Risk free rate at the time of 2021 was about 2%.

Risk premium was 5.5% based on [https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/)

COE = 8.35%

COD, GOOG’s bond yield was taken into consideration for this.

[https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:\~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85)](https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85))

COD = 3.625%

%Equity = 100% - 30.37% = 69.62%%Liability = 97072/319 616 = 30.37%Tax Rate = 19% based on 2021’s Taxes

📷

Extract from GOOG’s 2021 10-K

Total WACC = 69.62% x 8.35% + 30.37% x 3.625% x (1 - 19%) = 6.71%

TGR = 2.5%

some very specific questions I have:

1. Is my Tax forecast by holding it at 20% unrealistic?
2. Is it okay to keep depreciation constant at 7% of sales?
3. Unsure of how exactly to accurately depict change in NWC?
4.

As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Visa at its core is a payment processor. Visa connects the buyer and seller while a financial partner provides the cash in to facilitate the transaction. These partners are paid the value of rewards (client incentives) to hold in escrow to pay to end users of their cards.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ They earn revenue by facilitating payments between customers and merchants, data processing revenues to facilitate clearing and settlement, International transactions allow them to earn fees to enable cross-currency transaction and finally other revenues which is mainly licensing fees. Together, the above makes up gross revenue.

§ Their cards are used daily and are broken down between debit and credit transactions. Credit Cards are typically co-branded and affiliated with a bank (that provides the funds) and a company (which sets the terms of the awards). Debit cards are connected directly with a financial institution and allow you to pay directly from your account without providing your bank account number.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ No, they have $0.65 cents of debt for every $1.00 of equity and operate with an extremely high interest coverage ratio of 36x.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, while revenues will rise and fall with the economy, there cards will be used continuously. They have access to $950 million of commercial paper with no balance outstanding.

§ Visa also operates with a negative cash conversion cycle. This is in part enabled by collecting fees when they occur but pay rewards over time. This is tracked by capitalizing their rewards and making periodic payments.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ For sure. There are only 4 players in the credit card market: Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and Discovery. Visa has been in the payment space for over 60 years. Despite technological changes, they continue to remain at the center of the payment industry for reasons will describe below.

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. FCF margins have averaged a staggering 55.5% over the past 5 years, returns on assets over 15% over the past 5 years, steady revenue growth. Their financials are the envy of most of the world.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ The advantage is to replace Visa, you need to find a method to have customers want to use your new payment system and need to have merchants who accept the payment method. Additionally, Visa wisely pays incentives for using their cards. This adds a further barrier as you would omit a benefit by not using their card. Given their unprecedented scale they can leverage their extremely low operating costs over a massive revenue base enabling these massive margins. A smaller player would not have this level of scale and would need to burn a significant amount of capital to scale. Take new players of late. Venmo was able to get users and replaced sending your friends cash or checks but has had a difficult time being accepted by merchants for fees. Apple and Android pay brought their massive consumer lists to the digital world, but still rely on the cards as they don’t have the merchants nor do the programs offer rewards (outside of credit cards).

§ Additionally, Visa has no fear that it won’t be accepted. You know it is accepted virtually anywhere. Most consumers would not want the headache of a new payment system given the current system works so well.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ I don’t believe so. Their advantage is not so much based on allocating capital for a long time. It’s a brand of trusted secure payments with a well-entrenched network effect.

§ I think it will be extremely difficult for a new player to get merchants, customers and fund an incentive for using their new payment system.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ The network effect for payments.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, this history of payments overall is a story not for the faint of heart for most players. New technologies are always trying to enter the mix. Whether its crypto, Venmo or Cash App or whatever other new methods come down the pike there will always be threats to this market.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, Visa has grown revenues at 10% per year with stable fat margins. Cash still represents 20% of all transactions across the globe. This number will likely continue to dwindle over time giving Visa a nice tailwind to grow in excess of worldwide GDP growth +/- currency changes.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ I believe so.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ I feel it would be extremely difficult to kill.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Revenue FYE 09/30/22 was $29.310 billion for 2022

§ Revenue is forecast to be $39.451 billion for FYE 25

§ Revenue is forecast to $54.61 billion for FY 28

§ That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 10.41% from 22 to 25

§ That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 11.49% from 25 to 28

§ Shares have decreased by 1.5% and 1.9% per year over the past 3 and 5 years respectively. Most of these buybacks accrued with FCF yields of 3%. Since current FCF yield is slightly above this average, I feel it is fair to project that shares decrease a slightly more optimistic range of 1.5% to 2.25% per year.

§ With current shares outstanding of 1.883 billion, this suggests shares outstanding are estimated be 1.75 to 1.80 billion shares on 09/30/25.

§ Current dividend policy is $0.45 per quarter or $1.80 per share. Let’s hold that going forward. Having said that it will likely rise over the next 2 years.

§ Levered FCF margins are fairly stable. Lets assume 50% to 60% and I will use a 10% discount and premium to the estimated revenue with the low and high margins

§ Putting it all together you get a FCF per share of $9.86 to $14.88 on 09/30/25.

§ FCF Yields have averaged 3.2% over the past 5 years. Given the companies entrenchment and some cyclicality and that 3 years after 2025 its current expectations are to maintain a 10+% growth rate, a 3.5% to 4.5% FCF yield is fair in my view.

§ To value the company, I assumed the high FCF per share will be associated with higher yields and lower FCF per share will be paired with lower yield. This gives a range of value per share on 09/30/2025 of $281.79 to $330.64.

§ Currently shares are selling for $207 which implies a 15.6% annual return at the midpoint.

1671421269,1625,"BURIRAM, Thailand—Toyota Motor Corp. TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industry’s silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.

Auto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.

Still, challenges are mounting—particularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteries—and concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.

“People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,” Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. “That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly.”

While major rivals, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co., have set dates for when their lineups will be all-EV, Toyota has stuck to a strategy of investing in a diverse lineup of vehicles that includes hydrogen-powered cars and hybrids, which combine batteries with gas engines.

The world’s biggest auto maker has said it sees hybrids, a technology it invented with the debut of the Toyota Prius in the 1990s, as an important option when EVs remain expensive and charging infrastructure is still being built out in many parts of the world. It is also developing zero-emission vehicles powered by hydrogen.

“Because the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one option,” Mr. Toyoda said. Over the past few years, Mr. Toyoda said, he has tried to convey this point to industry stakeholders, including government officials—an effort he described as tiring at times.

Global car companies have made a sharp pivot to electric vehicles within the last few years, driven in part by the success of EV-only maker Tesla Inc.

Traditional auto makers such as Toyota, Ford and GM are also facing new competition from startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group Inc., which make EVs exclusively and have captivated Wall Street in recent years.

At the same time, the legacy auto makers have a much broader base of customers, including many living in rural areas and developing economies with unreliable electricity supplies.

And their gas-engine businesses are still driving the bulk of profits needed to fund the costly shift to electric vehicles, which not only requires the development of new models but also construction of new facilities and battery plants.

The infrastructure to charge electric vehicles is meanwhile still lacking in the U.S. and many other parts of the world, making owning an EV still a challenge for many types of consumers.

According to J.D. Power, the market share for EVs in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last couple of years. As of October, it was around 6.5% of the total new-car market, the firm said.

But that is largely because EV sales are growing faster in places such as California, where there are more options and a greater willingness among buyers to make the shift, J.D. Power analysts say. Sticker prices for electric vehicles have also jumped this year because of the rising cost of battery materials, limiting the pool of buyers who can afford one.

Auto executives say the uptake on EVs could be uneven for some time, and that gas-powered models, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will endure for many years to come.

“The coastal areas, the East and West Coast, that’s electrifying much quicker than the interior of the country,” said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Sweden’s Volvo Car AB. Mr. Rowan said plug-in hybrids serve the purpose of providing buyers with an option if they aren’t ready to go full electric and are important to warming them up to the technology.

Ryan Gremore, an Illinois-based dealer, who owns several brand franchises, said he gets a lot of customers inquiring about EVs, in part because of limited supplies.

That might give the impression of robust demand, but it is unclear how it will materialize when inventory levels at dealerships normalize, he added. “Is there interest in electric vehicles? Yes. Is it more than 10% to 15% of our customer base? No way,” Mr. Gremore said.

Mr. Toyoda’s long-held skepticism about a fully electric future has been shared by others in the Japanese car industry, as well.

Mazda Motor Corp. executives once cautioned that whether EVs were cleaner depends largely on where the electricity is produced. They also worried that EV batteries were too big and expensive to replace gas-powered models and better suited to the types of smaller vehicles that Americans didn’t want.

Nissan Motor Co., which launched the all-electric Leaf over a decade ago, had until recently taken a more cautious stance on EVs with executives saying they were waiting to see how the demand would materialize.

Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company moved too aggressively with the Leaf early on, but lately demand for EVs has been growing faster than many had initially expected. Nissan said last year it would spend roughly $14.7 billion to roll out new battery-powered models. Now, Mr. Uchida said it may need to spend more.

The wild card, he said, is regulations and government subsidies globally that could speed adoption even more. “Would that be enough? The answer is it may not be,” Mr. Uchida said.

Mr. Toyoda has argued that fully electric models aren’t the only way to reduce carbon emissions, saying hybrid vehicles sold in large volumes can also deliver a short-term impact. “It’s about what can be done now,” he said.

Mr. Toyoda’s cautionary tone toward EVs has caused some concern from investors and consumers that the auto maker could be falling behind in the EV race.

Toyota has been slower than rivals to roll out fully electric models in major markets such as the U.S., with its bZ4X electric SUV being recalled earlier this year because of a potential safety problem.

Mr. Toyoda said the auto maker was taking all types of vehicles seriously, including EVs. In late 2021, it revealed plans to spend up to $35 billion on its EV lineup through 2030. Since then, Toyota has disclosed sizable investments in EV manufacturing capacity in the U.S.

The Toyota chief also said alternatives to EVs, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, were beginning to get a warmer reception from government officials, members of the media and others involved in the auto industry.

“Two years ago, I was the only person making these kinds of statements,” Mr. Toyoda said.

1671551617,255,"First of all: I have no positions in TSLA. I like their financials and believe they can be long-term successful, but no matter how optimistically I valuate them the stock price is still a lot higher than what I'd be comfortable with for opening a position. Basically, as long as it's 3 digits I see no way to make this work from a value perspective, around 75 would be a good entry point if I'm somewhat optimistic, around 50 if I'm more conservative.

Now, for the fun of it, I decided to search for old-ish threads about TSLA. This so-called ""bear market"" started around beginning of 2022, so I want threads that are newer than that, after things already went down a bit.

There's a lot of them. But I'm grabbing out one from 10 months ago as an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/st09kt/tsla\_bullish\_price\_is\_287usd\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/st09kt/tsla_bullish_price_is_287usd_dd/)

It's by a guy who makes a case why he thinks TSLA is overvalued and he comes with a 287 USD target for it. At that time, TSLA was trading a bit above 300 or so. So his target isn't outrageously low compared to the price back then. It's also pre Ukraine war and energy crisis, but that didn't seem to be the major factor for TSLA, which traded at 380 in April.

OP in that thread put a lot of effort in this, and while I disagree about many assumptions, it was definitely not a hate post on TSLA, but an attempt on some DD and coming up with a fair price for a company he seems to like.

Boy, did that guy get a backlash. The top comment by u/32no lay out the case why this, actually insanely optimistic, valuation back then is ridiculous and the share price will never get that low, while others just went to ridiculing OP. The user I tagged here is still mostly defending TSLA, according to a look at his recent posts.

However, the stock price today is less than half than the target price OP came up with in the thread I linked. I would be really interested in hearing from people who bashed OP back then, what they think about their arguments in retrospect.

EDIT: one correction, it seems OP's price target was further below the price back then, since there was a 3:1 split afterwards. The price target roughly translates to a price of 95 today, which is still on the high side for TSLA, but much more realistic. All the conclusions, that while I find the price target too high, I respect the effort OP put in, and that I feel he has been treated quite unfairly by commenters, remain valid. I can understand that the larger price difference shocked some less-informed users back then and emotions ran a little higher, but that the analysis was even more sound than I initially thought makes the comments even sadder.","first all: positions tsla. like financials believe long-term successful, matter optimistically valuate stock price still lot higher comfortable opening position. basically, long 3 digits see way make work value perspective, around 75 would good entry point somewhat optimistic, around 50 conservative. now, fun it, decided search old-ish threads tsla. so-called ""bear market"" started around beginning 2022, want threads newer that, things already went bit. there's lot them. grabbing one 10 months ago example: ( guy makes case thinks tsla overvalued comes 287 usd target it. time, tsla trading bit 300 so. target outrageously low compared price back then. also pre ukraine war energy crisis, seem major factor tsla, traded 380 april. op thread put lot effort this, disagree many assumptions, definitely hate post tsla, attempt dd coming fair price company seems like. boy, guy get backlash. top comment u/32no lay case this, actually insanely optimistic, valuation back ridiculous share price never get low, others went ridiculing op. user tagged still mostly defending tsla, according look recent posts. however, stock price today less half target price op came thread linked. would really interested hearing people bashed op back then, think arguments retrospect. edit: one correction, seems op's price target price back then, since 3:1 split afterwards. price target roughly translates price 95 today, still high side tsla, much realistic. conclusions, find price target high, respect effort op put in, feel treated quite unfairly commenters, remain valid. understand larger price difference shocked less-informed users back emotions ran little higher, analysis even sound initially thought makes comments even sadder.","['USD', 'OP', 'Tesla']"

*****
&gt; With the end of 2022 in close sight, all three major averages are on pace to post their worst yearly performance since 2008 and break a 3-year win streak. As of Tuesday’s close, the Dow was down 9.6%. For the month, it’s toppled about 5%. The S&amp;P is down 19.82% for the year and more than 6% for December, while the Nasdaq’s plummeted 32.58% in 2022 and about 8% this month.

Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft. The challenge for investors is that the three companies don’t report cloud infrastructure metrics in a way that makes them easily comparable. However, an internal estimate assembled by Google employees, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market statistics, suggests Google believes it’s closer to second place than analysts think.

Google’s document estimates that Microsoft generated under $29 billion in Azure consumption revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, reflecting the value of cloud infrastructure services used by clients. That’s several billion dollars less than what Wall Street analysts had forecast. Bank of America was the most bullish, predicting Azure would pull in $37.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion and UBS said $32.3 billion. The document from Google has Azure ending the 2022 fiscal year with an operating loss of almost $3 billion, down from a loss of more than $5 billion the prior year. It claims that Azure’s sales and marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.

One analyst dismissed Google’s bottom-line tally. “There’s no way it’s that big of a loss,” said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google’s estimate of a -10% margin. According to data from Gartner, AWS controlled 39% of the global cloud infrastructure market in 2021, followed by Microsoft at 21%, China’s Alibaba at 9.5% and Google at 7.1%.","google years playing catch-up cloud infrastructure market, it’s seen industry distant third u.s., behind amazon microsoft. challenge investors three companies don’t report cloud infrastructure metrics way makes easily comparable. however, internal estimate assembled google employees, based leaked microsoft document extrapolation market statistics, suggests google believes it’s closer second place analysts think. google’s document estimates microsoft generated $29 billion azure consumption revenue latest fiscal year, ended june 30, reflecting value cloud infrastructure services used clients. that’s several billion dollars less wall street analysts forecast. bank america bullish, predicting azure would pull $37.5 billion fiscal 2022. cowen predicted revenue $33.9 billion ubs said $32.3 billion. document google azure ending 2022 fiscal year operating loss almost $3 billion, loss $5 billion prior year. claims azure’s sales marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting 34% consumption revenue. microsoft said sales marketing costs whole company equaled 11% revenue period. one analyst dismissed google’s bottom-line tally. “there’s way it’s big loss,” said derrick wood, analyst cowen equivalent buy rating microsoft stock. research shows azure boasting operating margin 30%, compared google’s estimate -10% margin. according data gartner, aws controlled 39% global cloud infrastructure market 2021, followed microsoft 21%, china’s alibaba 9.5% google 7.1%.","['AWS', 'Gartner', 'Amazon', 'UBS', 'Cowen', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/google-leaked-doc-microsoft-azure-losing-money-on-29-bln-in-revenue.html\n\nGoogle', 'Google', 'Bank of America', 'Microsoft']"

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Friday, but fall for a third straight week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as recession fears continue to batter investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82, while the and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176.44 points higher, or 0.5%, to 33,203.93.
*****
&gt; The major indexes oscillated earlier in the session after the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in slightly hotter than economists expected on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflation is sticking despite the Fed’s efforts to fight it.
*****
&gt; “The economic numbers announced today highlight the difficulty for investors today, where weak numbers bring recession fears and strong numbers bring Fed fear,” said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates.
*****
&gt; “You just can’t win right now on macro numbers,” he added. “That is why it’s now much more of a stock-picking market, but with all the index and ETF traders even stocks that are executing their business plan well can get pushed around meaningfully by associated losers.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week down about 0.2% for the week, posting its third straight weekly decline. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 2% for the week, also for the third down week in a row. The Dow was the outperformer, posting a 0.9% gain.
*****
&gt; Recession fears have resurged recently dashing some investors’ hope for a year-end rally and leading to big losses in December. Investors worry that overtightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn.
*****
&gt; For December, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have lost more than 4% and 8.5%, respectively. Those are the biggest monthly declines for the major averages since September. Stocks are also on pace for their worst annual performance since 2008.

&gt; # What You Need to Know About the Bank of Japan’s (Unexpected) Monetary Policy Change

&gt; The Bank of Japan (BOJ) made a surprise decision on Tuesday to widen the allowed trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from ~25 to ~50 basis points. This move signals a shift in the BOJ’s approach to monetary policy and inflation and is likely to be sustained by the incoming governor of the BOJ.

&gt; For context, Japan has implemented a dovish monetary policy stance for years, with the BOJ’s rates remaining at 0% and large-scale quantitative easing being standard practice. The central bank has targeted a range around zero for the benchmark government bond yield since 2016 and has used this as a tool to keep overall market interest rates low. The policy change could alter the flow of capital from Japan, a major exporter of capital.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JGB-vs-UST.png))**

&gt; The decision to widen the trading band caused the yen to spike and bond yields to rise. This caught investors off guard, who had expected the BOJ to wait to make changes to its yield curve control until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has spiked to 0.47%, close to the BOJ’s newly set implicit cap.

&gt; # The Largest Buyers of U.S. Treasuries, But for How Long?
&gt; Japanese investors have historically sought investment opportunities outside of Japan, and as of October 2022, they were the largest holders of US Treasuries. The BOJ’s decision can significantly alter this flow of capital, causing Japanese investors to reconsider purchasing US Treasuries. The market is currently pricing in higher Japanese yields and a stronger yen. The rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yield provides an increased incentive for Japanese investors to keep cash at home amid the global economic slowdown. This has the potential to negatively affect foreign risk assets, as well as strengthen the Yen versus the US Dollar.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dollar-vs-Yen.png))**

&gt; # A Preview of Things to Come?
&gt; The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) low-interest rate policy and its consistent purchase of bonds to maintain its yield cap have been criticized for distorting the yield curve, reducing market liquidity, and contributing to the yen’s depreciation, which has increased the cost of importing raw materials. The main question is whether this is a one-time adjustment or if we are getting a preview of what Japan’s new monetary policy approach will be moving forward.

&gt; This unexpected move by the Bank of Japan has the potential to be a headwind to the US Dollar as the Japanese Yen strengthens. We’ll continue to monitor the implications of the hawkish move by the Bank of Japan and be sure to keep you updated along the way.

&gt; # Russell 1,000 Stocks Down the Most from All-Time Highs

&gt; As we wrap up an awful year for the stock market, below we highlight a list of the current Russell 1,000 stocks that are the farthest below their all-time highs. For the index as a whole, the average stock is down 15.85% YTD on a total return basis, while the average stock's price is about 38% below its all-time high.

&gt; About 30% of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are currently at least 50% below their all-time highs, while about 10% of index members are at least 75% below all-time highs. Below we list the 38 stocks that are all down at least 85% from their all-time highs and it includes Palantir's (PLTR) 85.96% drop to Plug Power's (PLUG) near evaporation of 99.2%. Most of these names have come down from all-time highs that were made at some point in 2021, although some like PLUG, AIG, and Citi (C) made highs a long time ago.

&gt; This list is a who's who of stocks that got caught up in the post-COVID retail investor buying spree. A name like Carvana (CVNA) hit its all-time high of $376.69 relatively recently in August of last year. It's at $4.13/share as of this morning. Upstart (UPST) traded above $400/share last October, and it's at $13 and change now. Roku (ROKU) got up to $490.40 last summer and is at $42 now or more than a full decimal point to the left!

&gt; # The Best and Worst Performing Stocks of 2022 (through 12/22)

&gt; Below are lists of the best and worst performing Russell 1,000 stocks year-to-date on a total return basis. We'll start with the worst first. Five stocks in the index are down more than 90% this year: Carvana (CVNA), Opendoor (OPEN), Novavax (NVAX), Upstart (UPST), and Affirm (AFRM). Another eleven are down more than 80%, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), Twilio (TWLO), Wayfair (W), Lucid (LCID), and Roku (ROKU).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/riydownytd.png))**

&gt; Seventy-two percent of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are down YTD, but below are the names that have bucked the trend and gained the most. Just three stocks are up more than 100% YTD: Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Signify Health (SGFY), and Texas Pacific (TPL). Of the 38 names shown, 23 are from the Energy sector, with big names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) included. Exxon's 78.8% YTD gain is easily its biggest annual move higher since at least 1980. Merck (MRK) is the biggest of the non-Energy stocks that made the list with a YTD gain of 49.8%.

&gt; # Day After Christmas NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Up 73.5% Of Time

&gt; Santa Claus Rally starts today. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&amp;P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

&gt; It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale’s famous line states (2023 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have logged the greatest frequency and magnitude of gains on the day after Christmas. Since 1988, NASDAQ has advanced 73.5% of the time with an average move of +0.42%. R2K has also advanced 73.5% of the time with an average advance of +0.40%. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish, nonetheless.

&gt; Two days after Christmas, the market is less bullish with NASDAQ down more often than up. Three days after Christmas R2K small caps take the lead advancing 64.7% of the time with an average gain of +0.46%.

&gt; Looking further out, from 1950-1985 last 5 trading days of the year S&amp;P 500 up 34 of 36 years, average gain 1.24%. 1986-2021 up 19 of 36, average gain 0.43%.

&gt; # Is it Finally Time for The Santa Claus Rally?

&gt; “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”
—Yale Hirsh

&gt; One of the little-known facts about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is that it isn’t the entire month of December but is actually only seven days. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real SCR is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official SCR is set to begin tomorrow, Friday, December 23, 2022.

&gt; Historically, it turns out these seven days indeed have been quite jolly, as no seven-day combo is more likely to be higher (up 79.2% of the time), and only two combos have a better average return for the S&amp;P 500 than the 1.33% average return during the official Santa Claus Rally period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-188.png))**

&gt; Here’s a chart we shared recently showing that it is the latter half of December when most of the seasonally strong gains occur.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-255.png))**

&gt; These seven days tend to be in the green, so that is expected. But fun trivia stat, the SCR has been higher the past six years and hasn’t been higher seven years in a row since the ‘70s. The all-time record was an incredible 10-year winning streak in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Here we show all the SCR periods since the tech bubble and how the S&amp;P 500 does after each.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-356.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is that what really matters to investors is when Santa doesn’t come, as Mr. Hirsch noted in the quote at the start of this blog.

&gt; Here we show some recent times investors were given coal during these seven days, and the results after aren’t very good at all. The past five times that the SCR was negative saw January down as well. Then consider when there was no SCR in 2000 and 2008, not the best times for investors, and potentially some major warnings that something wasn’t right. Lastly, the full year was negative in 1994 and 2015 after no Santa. We like to say in the Carson Investment Research team that hope isn’t a strategy, but I’m hoping for some green during the SCR!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-46.png))**

&gt; Finally, the average gains each year for the S&amp;P 500 is 9.3% and is higher 71.8% of the time. But when there is a SCR, those numbers jump to 10.5% and 73.2%, falling to only 5.0% and 66.7% when there is no Santa. Sure, this is only one indicator, and we suggest following many more indicators to base your investment decisions, but this is clearly something we wouldn’t ignore either.

&gt; # Don’t Lose Faith Yet

&gt; Stocks have sold off hard after the Fed took a more hawkish-than-expected tone last week, which now has stocks looking at one of their worst December returns ever. The good news is that there is still time, and one of the most bullish times of the year is right around the corner.

&gt; We will discuss in more detail the Santa Claus rally tomorrow, as it officially starts on Friday. But today, I’ll do a quick blog with a table that is always very popular.

&gt; As you can see, this table breaks down how each day of the year does. In my opinion, we are amid some of the strongest days of the year, from late December to early January. With stocks quite oversold and sentiment extremely negative, we expect a rally quite soon.

&gt; # No Worse Year for Sentiment

&gt; The past few weeks had been uneventful when it comes to the AAII's weekly reading on investor sentiment. As we noted last week, the three-week range that bullish sentiment occupied had reached a record low hovering between 24.3% and 24.7%. In the latest release, sentiment finally moved but not in the most promising direction. Bullish sentiment dropped 4 percentage points down to 20.3% this week to make for the lowest reading since the end of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; With a decline in neutral sentiment as well, all of the increase went to bears with that reading rising to the highest level and back above 50% for the first time since late October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result of the large inverse moves of the two sentiment readings, the bull-bear spread shows a dramatic tilt towards an even more pessimistic bias with bears outnumbering bulls by 32 percentage points. That is the widest spread since the week of October 20th and lower than most of the past decade's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; With yet another week of bears outnumbering bulls, the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread has grown to 38 weeks long; a full month longer than the previous record ending in October 2020. Historically, investor sentiment has acted as a contrarian indicator meaning low readings on optimism have typically been followed by stronger returns for the S&amp;P 500. This time around, sentiment and prices have given each other little reason to turn around.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; In an earlier post, we noted how there has not even been a single week this year in which bullish sentiment has been above the historical average of 37.6%. Taking another look at just how depressed sentiment has been, the average bullish sentiment reading in 2022 has been less than 25%. The only years that had come close to such a low reading were 1988 (27.29%) and 1990 (27.08%). Playing into that low average has been the fact that there have been a record 30 weeks this year with bullish sentiment coming in below 25%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has averaged 46.17% this year, slightly above the previous record of 45.2% in 2008. With bearish sentiment tipping back above 50% once again this week, there have now been 17 weeks with such an elevated reading, tying the record from 2008 with one week to go.

&gt; # Malaise Among Individual Investors

&gt; The misery of 2022 has continued when it comes to investor sentiment. In the latest weekly AAII poll, bullish sentiment declined from 24.3% down to 20.3%. That's the lowest reading since the end of September and less than five points above the YTD low of 15.8% from mid-April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-aaii.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart above, there hasn't been a single week this year where bullish sentiment has been above its historical average of 37.6%, and the only week where sentiment was even close to its historical average was at the start of the year. With just one week left in the year, barring a historic one-week surge, 2022 will go down as the first year in the history of the AAII survey where there wasn't a single week that bullish sentiment was above average. Talk about malaise.

&gt; # Mega-Caps Down $5 Trillion in Market Cap, AMZN Now Down $1+ Trillion

&gt; As we approach the end of 2022, below is an updated look at the drawdown in market cap that we've seen in the US equity space since major indices peaked on the first trading day of the year. Using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy, the US stock market has seen an $11.7 trillion drawdown from the peak on 1/3/22. The max drawdown was $13.6 trillion at the low on 9/30, so we've seen market cap increase by just under $2 trillion since then. In dollar terms, this drawdown has been more extreme than anything investors have ever experienced. That's pretty deflationary if you ask us!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/drawdownray.png))**

&gt; Of the $11.7 trillion drawdown in US equity market cap, just over $5 trillion of the drop has come from six companies! Below is a look at the six current and former ""trillion dollar market cap"" club members that have now collectively lost about $5.07 trillion in market cap from their peaks. As shown, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) have all lost at least $750 billion in market cap from their highs. And Amazon (AMZN) is the first to lose more than $1 trillion in market cap! Just a few years ago, no company had a market cap of more than a trillion dollars, and now we have a company that has lost more than a trillion dollars in market cap.

&gt; For all six of these companies, their current drawdowns are easily their biggest on record. Apple (AAPL) has lost $880 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down $846 billion, Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are both down more than $760 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) is down $784 billion even though it was down close to a trillion at its lows in November.

1671850615,1947,"Been a TSLA investor since 2017. This week I made the decision to pull out of the company (over 1,500 shares). After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.

Being a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' 

However, there has been a change. Things with Elon have certainly become more radical and it seems that every single day there is a new headline that is slowly destroying the brand. Now, before we get into the whole ""but Elon isn't Tesla!"" let me tell you the incredible importance of consumer sentiment and branding. 

I do not imagine Tesla ever being divorced from Elon Musk. When you think ""Tesla"" you cannot escape thinking ""Elon Musk."" It is like trying to think about Microsoft without thinking or mentioning Bill Gates or some other strong brand-to-noun association. Go ahead and do yourself a favor and search Tesla now and see what comes up. Headline after headline is about Musk. This is not good for the brand, especially considering their consumer segment is actively being isolated. 

Now, one must ask: why do people buy things? There's a wide array of reasons, but I believe fundamentally it boils down to the value and reputation of the product. The value has a mix of factors that range from price, functionality, importance, etc. and reputation can be understood as how the brand is perceived, how the consumer is perceived as a result of owning the product, and how the consumer feels owning the product. This is where I lose the belief in the growth potential despite the positioning. Simply put, I do not think consumers are going to feel good about buying a Tesla with the negativity surrounding Elon. 

A mere year ago, if a person bought a Tesla or owned a Tesla, what would this say about a person? How would that person feel about that purchase? Tesla was the cool, sophisticated brand that was essentially symbolic of changing the world. Just look at Tesla's mission statement: ""Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. Tesla is accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy."" 

Where is this brand now? How would a person feel now? Ask yourself, if someone pulled up in a Tesla what would you think about them? What feelings would it invoke?

Often times, we want to distance ourselves from feelings and sentiment and put an enormous emphasis on reason, facts, and data. This is not necessarily wrong, but this is certainly also not unique to the financial realm and TSLA has a history of this as well. We had people putting in orders for vehicles that were not being produced, people YOLOing their life savings into the stock because they believed in the future growth of the company before the company was seriously competitive, an unprecedented cult-like following that boosted the stock and gave the company an incredible amount of capital, and so on. Yet, when we look at TSLA now and think about the projected growth, why think people will actually want to continue to buy this product? Who is going to spend the money of a luxury vehicle to suddenly be associated with a person that people are increasingly viewing in a negative way? Not me. Apparently not my friends or co-workers either who were previously considering a Tesla and now want nothing to do with it. And apparently not my friend who is a Tesla owner and is starting to feel embarrassed for driving one. We can talk about how ""dumb"" these people are, but we cannot escape these are legitimate and valid sentiments toward the brand that have real costs associated with them.  

The sentiment cannot be captured in a graph right now. You have no data points on the would-be consumers because they are now never-were consumers. This data is only going to show in their sales. If sales continue to go up, then it seems reasonable to say that consumer sentiment has not reached a level where people feel so negatively about the product that they stopped buying. What I am suggesting here is that it my belief that this will inevitably happen because of the intimate link between Tesla and Elon. Tesla could get a new CEO, change leadership, etc., but I do not see them escaping this link and I believe it will ultimately be the detriment to the brand. Sales will not completely stop, but the growth projections that the stock relied heavily on I believe will certainly slow a lot sooner than shareholders anticipated and if it ever does reach previous target prices of $250+, this will not be for a long time. 

I'm not bullish or bearish on the stock. I do not think the company is going to suddenly vanish and the stock will drop to &lt;$50 (at least I hope not for many of the investors I know). However, I also do not think the growth will be as aggressive as it once could have been and this is going to limit the stock in many ways. If we factor in slowed growth from the recession, one must keep in mind that this is just more time for Elon to further damage the brand between now and when people are in better buying conditions. What's next? Apparently removing Twitter's suicide prevention feature. Maybe tomorrow it's denying climate change and next month will be another stock sell off after yet another promise of not doing so. Though, ultimately, this is no longer my problem. The integrity of my financial future is no longer jeopardized by a guy that is becoming increasingly unhinged without the board properly exercising their duty to act in the interest of shareholders.

My thoughts on being a TSLA investor is what my mother used to say: it's been real, it's been fun, but it hasn't been real fun.","tsla investor since 2017. week made decision pull company (over 1,500 shares). 800%+ one point, left came crashing back ~180%. incur loss, walking away retirement levels money could possibly walked away mere year ago. dumb? maybe. need sell? no. give peace? absolutely. tsla investor interesting. elon always elon believe company indeed positioned long-term growth (even now). plenty ups downs, never 'doubted vibe' elon antics latter half 2022 would described almost eccentric. guy idiot time time, definitely something right. tesla competitive, innovative, leader ev space. long-term, company ton upward potential. emphasis word 'potential.' however, change. things elon certainly become radical seems every single day new headline slowly destroying brand. now, get whole ""but elon tesla!"" let tell incredible importance consumer sentiment branding. imagine tesla ever divorced elon musk. think ""tesla"" cannot escape thinking ""elon musk."" like trying think microsoft without thinking mentioning bill gates strong brand-to-noun association. go ahead favor search tesla see comes up. headline headline musk. good brand, especially considering consumer segment actively isolated. now, one must ask: people buy things? there's wide array reasons, believe fundamentally boils value reputation product. value mix factors range price, functionality, importance, etc. reputation understood brand perceived, consumer perceived result owning product, consumer feels owning product. lose belief growth potential despite positioning. simply put, think consumers going feel good buying tesla negativity surrounding elon. mere year ago, person bought tesla owned tesla, would say person? would person feel purchase? tesla cool, sophisticated brand essentially symbolic changing world. look tesla's mission statement: ""tesla's mission accelerate world's transition sustainable energy increasingly affordable electric vehicles addition renewable energy generation storage. tesla accelerating world's transition sustainable energy."" brand now? would person feel now? ask yourself, someone pulled tesla would think them? feelings would invoke? often times, want distance feelings sentiment put enormous emphasis reason, facts, data. necessarily wrong, certainly also unique financial realm tsla history well. people putting orders vehicles produced, people yoloing life savings stock believed future growth company company seriously competitive, unprecedented cult-like following boosted stock gave company incredible amount capital, on. yet, look tsla think projected growth, think people actually want continue buy product? going spend money luxury vehicle suddenly associated person people increasingly viewing negative way? me. apparently friends co-workers either previously considering tesla want nothing it. apparently friend tesla owner starting feel embarrassed driving one. talk ""dumb"" people are, cannot escape legitimate valid sentiments toward brand real costs associated them. sentiment cannot captured graph right now. data points would-be consumers never-were consumers. data going show sales. sales continue go up, seems reasonable say consumer sentiment reached level people feel negatively product stopped buying. suggesting belief inevitably happen intimate link tesla elon. tesla could get new ceo, change leadership, etc., see escaping link believe ultimately detriment brand. sales completely stop, growth projections stock relied heavily believe certainly slow lot sooner shareholders anticipated ever reach previous target prices $250+, long time. bullish bearish stock. think company going suddenly vanish stock drop &lt;$50 (at least hope many investors know). however, also think growth aggressive could going limit stock many ways. factor slowed growth recession, one must keep mind time elon damage brand people better buying conditions. what's next? apparently removing twitter's suicide prevention feature. maybe tomorrow denying climate change next month another stock sell yet another promise so. though, ultimately, longer problem. integrity financial future longer jeopardized guy becoming increasingly unhinged without board properly exercising duty act interest shareholders. thoughts tsla investor mother used say: real, fun, real fun.","['Microsoft', 'Tesla']"

1671890858,271,"As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.

§ They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.

§ Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)

§ Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%

§ ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%

§ FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets

§ Low-Cost Provider:

· Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins.

· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.

§ Intangibles

· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.

· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.

· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.

· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.

· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.

§ It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.

§ When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Ha! Difficult, very difficult!

§ 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion

§ 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)

§ 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28)

§ Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449

§ Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0%

§ Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4%

§ Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.

§ This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.

§ Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.

§ To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25.

§ At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.

§ With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.

§ When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05

§ With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

1671894355,0,"A lot of posts about folks dumping Tesla. Here are some counter points. I welcome feedback! Please be civil. 

1.	I sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again. 

2.	Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn’t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)

3.	Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!

4.	They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something “frivolous” like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. 

5.	Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. 

6.	Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes “fat” (ask any body builder). The “recession” is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!

7.	Tesla is more than a car company”. This is a polarizing statement! But let’s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do. 

8.	They are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple’s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!

9.	Important point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution. Every challenge has been met with bold strategy and then executed to critical success. The team is the same, so why should the results be any different 10 years from now? Elon is one man and sure he may have brain fart from now and then, but the team and culture (results oriented) he has developed for the last 10 years will be the difference maker!

10. Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest. I’m confident that even in the absence of Elon, there will be a competent leader who take the reins and extract greatness. 

11. I’m not going to call Elon a genius yet. But he is operating at much higher scale when compared to everyone else. Setting aside his success with PayPal. To gestate Tesla and at the same time expand into solar &amp; rockets and compete successfully should show you that the man is not normal. And with this, you should expect some level of eccentricity. If not for this eccentricity (his downfall) he would likely rule the world. Be glad that Twitter is the channel for his eccentricities vs Tesla. 

Again, these are all the musings of a random fool that is me. I have an investment in Tesla and am adding to my position slowly but surely. The thesis behind my investment has not changed and there is nothing yet that gives me worry (yet).","lot posts folks dumping tesla. counter points. welcome feedback! please civil. 1. sincerely doubt people shying away tesla elon. even are, short term phenomenon involvement twitter. like stupid forays, foray come end well money rush back again. 2. tesla makes great cars. buyers remorse almost non existent. people love cars, flaws all! isn’t car anywhere close technology perspective.

1671897690,0,"Hello all fellow investors,
I’ve decided to share my thoughts on my portfolio allocation and strategy moving forward. 

💰Portfolio allocation 

•30% in alternative investments I cannot discuss here 


•30% TSLA/growth stocks
At these levels Tesla could 3x again just by revisiting ATH. They are in a good position, growth wise and I’m a long term believer in the company. There are also other growth stocks I may want to add as well and I would group LEAPS into this category as well. Growth stocks offer lots of volatility and thus the option premiums are higher. I will sell covered calls on parts of my position and if I’m called away I’ll revert to selling cash secured puts. If I’m unable to get back in then I’m fine with that because I’ll always keep my other position naked. 

•0-10% cash
I’ve never kept cash on the side and mainly got mines from my paycheck or selling other investments. However I think it’s good to keep some dry powder. During bear markets I can use this cash on T-Bills, BIL, or leaving it in a money market account. During bull markets I can dump it into spy, use it to sell puts, or invest it into growth stocks or safer assets. I say 0-10% because I would want to be fully invested once the fed pivots. 

•30% safe assets 
In this bucket I keep assets that are widely considered safe. Here is where I’ll hold real estate, spy, value stocks, etc. Investing into these types of assets is a good idea because they don’t drop as much during bear markets and they steadily climb. Additionally, the very best investment one could make is in the spy. If one invests into the spy, then by definition they’re going to trail the market. 

I have to be honest with myself and note that I don’t always beat the market and when I do it sometimes isn’t by a wide margin. We’re all here to make money and sometimes that means doing the most layman thing of holding index funds. By having some allocation into spy I’ll have peace of mind when it comes to not falling behind the markets own rate of return. 

📈Basic portfolio strategy going forward

Furthermore, right now my strategy is to hoard cash and wait for a fed pivot once either inflation stays down at 2% and/or unemployment spikes. Until either of those things happen, I’m not expecting a fed pivot anytime soon. I have been averaging down into some positions like alternative investments and Tesla, but nothing too crazy. The lion share of my positions are just cash. 

I have learned that you do not want to fight the fed under any circumstances. They control the money and thus control the investing world. For instance, the Singaporean stock market has gone nowhere because Singapore does not have QE. Same goes for other international indexes. Liquidity drives markets first and foremost. No liquidity, no capital appreciation. 

-When they pivot to a hawkish stance I will sell out of all of my investments and go into short term government bonds until they pivot. Synthetic shorts, covered calls, go into effect here. No DCA

-When they pivot to a dovish stance, use 90% of cash to buy growth and other high alpha names and then slowly stop buying growth and begin adding value. This is because growth will outperform value when the fed first pivots so I don’t want to have much value stocks. I will DCA throughout the expansion.

This strategy isn’t perfect but all booms and bust in the most recent decades have been because of the fed inducing them. A fed pivot means a change in trend. And you reduce a lot of risk if you invest accordingly. 


In closing, I hope this sub can stand to benefit from my opinions. I’m open to criticism. DYOR and invest safe.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday he does not plan to sell any more shares of Tesla for at least the next two years, after the billionaire and nascent Twitter owner offloaded nearly $3.6 billion worth of stock this week as Tesla's share price tumbled.

Musk said during a Twitter Spaces audio call he will stop offloading Tesla stock after selling nearly $40 billion worth of it in the past year.

Tesla's share price dropped nearly 9% Thursday to close at $125.35, as investors grow increasingly concerned about demand for the company’s electric vehicles and leery of the massive amount of time Musk is devoting to running Twitter.

The drop put Tesla nearly 70% of its all-time high in January, when the stock at its peak traded above $400 and Tesla's market capitalization swelled to $1.2 trillion—pushing Musk’s net worth, which is mostly made up of Tesla shares, above $300 billion.","recession end around mid 2024. then, elon dump again. recession ends quicker, dump sooner. every bubble eventually bursts. matter dump, matter when. tesla ceo elon musk said thursday plan sell shares tesla least next two years, billionaire nascent twitter owner offloaded nearly $3.6 billion worth stock week tesla's share price tumbled. musk said twitter spaces audio call stop offloading tesla stock selling nearly $40 billion worth past year. tesla's share price dropped nearly 9% thursday close $125.35, investors grow increasingly concerned demand company’s electric vehicles leery massive amount time musk devoting running twitter. drop put tesla nearly 70% all-time high january, stock peak traded $400 tesla's market capitalization swelled $1.2 trillion—pushing musk’s net worth, mostly made tesla shares, $300 billion.","['Elon', 'Twitter Spaces', 'Tesla']"
1671986177,224,"Tesla ($TSLA) is down 69% YTD. Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.

In my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.

***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**

Although Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.

**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.

**Reason #2: Insiders selling**

Over the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.

|Name|\# of shares sold|Average price|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elon Musk|97,004,591|$246.94|$23,954,081,846|
|Vaibhav Taneja|58,683|$337.81|$19,823,747|
|Zach Kirkhorn|52,418|$253.05|$13,264,312|
|Drew Balgino|147,601|$277.45|$40,951,954|
|Kathleen Wilson-Thompson|105,000|$289.03|$30,348,062|
|Robyn M Denholm|299,700|$284.84|$85,366,262|
|**Total**|**97,667,993**|**$247.20**|**$24,143,836,183**|

Of course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.

However, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.

**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**

So far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.

Elon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.

**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.

**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**

If you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.

If we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.

So, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:

1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.
2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)

Based on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.

**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.

**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**

None of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.

**So, why am I buying?**

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.

The market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!

1672061569,31,"# INTRODUCTION:

DIS has 2 main revenue sources, Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP).

**DMED** includes things like their Linear Network (Disney Channel, ESPN etc.) and Direct to Consumer(DTC) products like Disney+ and Hulu.**DPEP** includes things like their Theme Parks, Merchandising and Intellectual Property Licensing.

As per 2021's 10-K DMED takes up about 75% of revenue while DPEP takes up the remaining 25%.

# REVENUE(DMED):

I forecast that DMED will continue taking the bulk of revenue based on Management's guidance from the 2021 Q4 earnings call. “We don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022.” So because DPEP will only recover to a limited extent DMED will continue to grow faster than DPEP and continue occupying the majority of revenue.

DMED's revenue driver with the largest growth prospect seems to come from their DTC products especially Disney+ with Linear Network seeming to be a matured business. However, based on management's guidance ""reaching between 230 and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year.” I'd assume that in the best case scenario Disney+ does not raise prices to continue attracting subscribers. So Y/Y growth is likely to be limited as Disney+ as of 2021 was only at about 118 million halfway of the forecasted subscribers needed by 2024.

# Revenue(DPEP):

I forecast that DPEP should brighten up over time as covid-19 restrictions get lifted and they return back to full operational capability without any covid-19 restrictions. China's zero covid policy does have a negative impact on Shanghai Disneyland, however this impact on overall DPEP's revenue is limited as most of DPEP's revenue comes from the US.

Not much guidance was given for merchandising, but Walt Disney has always been a strong licensor of their IPs so it's safe to assume that merchandising is mostly unaffected.

# EBIT:

DIS is expected to have higher operating expense in order to meet their subscriber goal by 2024. Things such as higher production cost as DIS has released 37 movies in 2022 compared to 21 in 2021. And higher advertising cost,  advertising cost was increased by 17% in 2021 from 2020 mainly to advertise DIS DTC.

There is also expected to be higher labor cost to run Disneyland as covid restrictions get lifted. Seeing how DIS is perceived as a luxury good. With their competitor's Six Flags cheapest tickets being at $25 while DIS is at about $80. In this tougher inflationary environment, consumers are likely to be less willing to spend more on luxury good so revenue from DPEP is likely to take a hit and DIS does incur high fixed cost such as maintenance cost.

So overall, EBIT is likely to at the best case scenario maintain at 9% from last year's margin.

# OVERALL:

Y/Y revenue growth for 2022 I'd assume it's going to increase from 3.10% in 2021 to about 5.75% in 2022. Revenue growth is likely to be driven mainly by higher subscribers but other than that, I'd expect not much growth.

For 2023-2025, under the assumption that the FED's interest path and goals are met it should be cheaper for DIS to utilise leverage to reinvest back into the firm and grow Disney+. However I'm conservative in expecting too much out of Disney+ as NFLX will be releasing ad supported plans by November 2022 but revenue growth should still be strong regardless. I forecast about 7.1% of Y/Y revenue for 2023 and 2024.

For 2025, once interest rates are substantially lowered it should be significantly cheaper for DIS to reinvest back into the firm and ramp up production. As DIS relies on ""telling the world’s most original and enduring stories. Second, maximizing the synergy of our unique eco-system to deepen consumers’ connection to our characters and stories.” to maximize their revenue. The growing subscriber base for Disney+ and the higher production should increase the appeal of the disney brand, increasing both DPEP and DMED.

EBIT is likely to increase overtime as DIS gains more internal economies of scales from ramping up production for DTC products and overall improve efficiency as DIS seems to not be very efficiently run with margins being at 9% for 2021 compared to 17% for 2019 precovid.

# ASSUMPTION:

1. Taxes are assumed to be at 30% of EBIT throughout my forecast period, this amount may be very high but DIS taxes have always been weird. As seen from here: [https://imgur.com/a/BW4428X](https://imgur.com/a/BW4428X)
2. D&amp;A is more stable so I assumed it to be at constant 7% of revenue throughout my forecast period.
3. Deferred Taxes is assumed to be at constant 2% of EBIT. Deferred taxes have also always been weird my guess is because DIS changed how they recognized revenue a while ago so there isn't consistency in this. As seen from here: [https://imgur.com/a/lRkmQ2a](https://imgur.com/a/lRkmQ2a)
4. Change in NWC is assumed to be constant at 1.5% of revenue. There was a trend of about 1%-3% of change in NWC for DIS so I took the middle ground.
5. CapEx is assumed to be 8% for 2022 and 2023 as DIS ramps up R&amp;D to efficiently run Disney+ but drops back down to 7% in 2024 and 6% in 2025.
6. WACC and TGR are 8.2% and 3% respectively.

# CONCLUSION:

Overall, my stock price for DIS is $78.68 which seems that current prices are way too expensive to jump in on DIS.

Areas of weakness I can identify for my DCF would be that I'm very uncertain of how Linear Network(DMED) and Merchandising(DPEP) are currently affected by current environment. WACC was also quite uncertain for me when I tried calculating it.

I'd love to hear some feedback or criticism for my thought processes and if I'm being too bearish on DIS.

Meta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook’s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabet’s share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.

“Four years ago, you wouldn’t be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising,” said Dischler. “So it’s really telling that more and more people are acknowledging that advertising is a great and scalable business model.” Amazon’s foray into the digital ads world has played a big part in hitting Meta and Google’s dominance. After years of toying in the market, it ramped efforts up in 2015 and has since seen ad revenues skyrocket from less than $1 billion to an estimated $38 billion this year. “Before I joined, I didn’t even know what Amazon Ads was,” said an Amazon executive who says they now run “a massive team—and I didn’t know this existed before the recruiter called.” Paul Prior, chief operating officer of Undertone, a digital advertising company, said retail giants led by Amazon woke up to the realization that their extensive data on customers could be the basis for a massive advertising business with higher margins than the sale of goods online. But Amazon then went a step further, expanding its on-site ads business beyond its own shopping site. “Across the wider digital universe, they use that data set to empower brands and the advertisers to buy better, to spend more effectively and drive return on ad-spend,” said Prior.

Apple has also emerged as a new threat. Its ad revenues have grown from under $2.2 billion in 2018 to more than $7 billion this year. Although that is just 1.2 percent of the global market, it is already more than Snapchat and Pinterest combined, and some estimates suggest Apple could reach $30 billion of ad revenue by 2026. Zuckerberg has repeatedly hit out at Apple’s “conflict of interest,” criticizing it for charging “monopoly rents” and stifling innovation.  Insider Intelligence has forecast that Google and Meta’s US ad growth in 2023 will be just 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, while at least eight of its rivals are to experience double-digit gains.","meta alphabet lost dominance digital advertising market ruled years, duopoly hit fast-growing competition rivals amazon, tiktok, microsoft apple. share us ad revenues held facebook’s parent meta google owner alphabet projected fall 2.5 percentage points 48.4 percent year, first time two groups hold majority share market since 2014, according research group insider intelligence. mark fifth consecutive annual decline duopoly, whose share market fallen peak 54.7 percent 2017 forecast decline 43.9 percent 2024. worldwide, meta alphabet’s share declined 1 percentage point 49.5 percent year. “four years ago, wouldn’t talking either advertising,” said dischler. “so it’s really telling people acknowledging advertising great scalable business model.” amazon’s foray digital ads world played big part hitting meta google’s dominance. years toying market, ramped efforts 2015 since seen ad revenues skyrocket less $1 billion estimated $38 billion year. “before joined, didn’t even know amazon ads was,” said amazon executive says run “a massive team—and didn’t know existed recruiter called.” paul prior, chief operating officer undertone, digital advertising company, said retail giants led amazon woke realization extensive data customers could basis massive advertising business higher margins sale goods online. amazon went step further, expanding on-site ads business beyond shopping site. “across wider digital universe, use data set empower brands advertisers buy better, spend effectively drive return ad-spend,” said prior. apple also emerged new threat. ad revenues grown $2.2 billion 2018 $7 billion year. although 1.2 percent global market, already snapchat pinterest combined, estimates suggest apple could reach $30 billion ad revenue 2026. zuckerberg repeatedly hit apple’s “conflict interest,” criticizing charging “monopoly rents” stifling innovation. insider intelligence forecast google meta’s us ad growth 2023 3 percent 5 percent, respectively, least eight rivals experience double-digit gains.","['TikTok', 'https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/meta-and-alphabet-lose-dominance-over-us-digital-ads-market/\n\nMeta', 'Amazon', 'Facebook’s', 'Undertone', 'Meta', 'Apple', 'Pinterest', 'Google', 'Alphabet', 'Meta’s US', 'Microsoft']"

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Tuesday as the final trading days of 2022 kicked off and investors hoped a Santa Claus rally will appear and lift a market that has been weighed down by recession fears.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 160 points, or 0.48%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; During the regular session Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176 points higher, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the start of the time period for a Santa Claus rally, which is typically considered the final five-day trading stretch in the current year, as well as the first two trading days in the new year. Markets were closed Monday for the Christmas holiday.
*****
&gt; Due to low trading volumes, investors are expecting either relative quiet or further volatility during the holiday-shortened week. Markets are closing out a month and year defined by a surge in recession fears.
*****
&gt; In December, the S&amp;P 500 dropped roughly 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq dropped about 4% and 8.5%, respectively. These are the biggest monthly declines since September. The major averages are headed for their worst annual performance since 2008.
*****
&gt; ″[The] question of what kind of recession remains unanswered,” Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote Friday. “And for this, the answer is dictated primarily from how much more the Fed needs to raise rates to finally tackle sticky inflation.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders are expecting the latest data on November wholesale inventories and the October S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home prices Tuesday before the bell.

1672155636,0,"The darkest of night usually felt the longest, yet daylight is just moment away. 

Chart pattern for S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 now look almost like they were at the peak of the 2008 crash. Back then, when the bottom was reached, it staggered up a little with volatility then down again, at which point the entire investing world was sure the world was doomed. It is the same now, and the investing world feels exactly the same just like they did during the peak of 2008 crash. In reality back then, it got near the low, but never got lower, then it recovered, and for months of upside, no one believed in that recovery until it was so obvious there could not be counter-argument anymore. 

Hint of a bottom can be seen in the stock market heat map (Finviz has a good one). It is obvious that free falling TSLA is leading to margin calls and selling elsewhere, notably tech tickers. Elsewhere in the market, no major price action is being seen. There is a limit how much more TSLA can fall, and the way I visualize it, TSLA heat map will become smaller if it continues to fall, and the smaller (cap) TSLA will be, the less ""infectious"" it will be to other tech tickers. Some time later, the chain reaction would stop. Elsewhere in the market, free falling had already stopped. 

We are at peak fear. 6 months or even 1 year ago, China's reopening would have ushered a massive rally. Today, everyone ignores this very major news, and there is only panic albeit limited to tech tickers. It is my humble opinion that the bottom is in. The light is at the end of the tunnel. Good luck everyone and may 2023 be a great year.","darkest night usually felt longest, yet daylight moment away. chart pattern sp 500 nasdaq 100 look almost like peak 2008 crash. back then, bottom reached, staggered little volatility again, point entire investing world sure world doomed. now, investing world feels exactly like peak 2008 crash. reality back then, got near low, never got lower, recovered, months upside, one believed recovery obvious could counter-argument anymore. hint bottom seen stock market heat map (finviz good one). obvious free falling tsla leading margin calls selling elsewhere, notably tech tickers. elsewhere market, major price action seen. limit much tsla fall, way visualize it, tsla heat map become smaller continues fall, smaller (cap) tsla be, less ""infectious"" tech tickers. time later, chain reaction would stop. elsewhere market, free falling already stopped. peak fear. 6 months even 1 year ago, china's reopening would ushered massive rally. today, everyone ignores major news, panic albeit limited tech tickers. humble opinion bottom in. light end tunnel. good luck everyone may 2023 great year.","['Chart', 'Tesla']"

For sure, consumer and enterprise technology will remain integral in people's lives, even during a recession, leading to continued demand for products.

1672179309,115," I am nearing 50% down, almost -200K.

Something like 85K is gone as it was tied to stock that I have no position at the moment (e.g., stocks like tdoc which I sold back when it fell around 30, incurring a 50K loss, and now it is trading low 20s, so not regretting it as much as I did when I sold)...

But here are my current holdings, where I am still hanging on hoping to salvage the 115K or so at some point.

For the sake of peace of mind, will it be a good approach to slowly get out of my stock positions and dca more into VOO and VTI (say for example, liquidate 100K of my big tech stocks in the coming few weeks and start DCAing 5K into VOO/VTI every week for 20 weeks).

PS: I don't need the money for quite some time (I want to buy a condo next year, but I have 100K or so in my savings account).

1672207465,4,"Sup Friends.

With the year ending and dividends/capital gains/401K company match (100% up to 8% of my salary at $110K/year), I'm looking to change up future contributions and move some money around as well as see what everyone's 2023 outlook is and possibly a thumbs up/down on the plan below.

Current break down of my Fidelity 401K ratios is:

Fidelity 500 Index (FXAIX) -- 45.25% -- YTD:   -18.03%

Vanguard Growth Index (VIGIX) -- 33.90% -- YTD:   -32.97%

Fidelity Freedom 2050 K6 (FZTKX) -- 20.85% -- YTD:   -18.00%

FZTKX pays out dividends/capital gains on 12/30/22.  Thinking about closing out FZTKX and moving it all into VIGIX as we are basically at Oct/Nov lows and have a feeling the worst is behind us with a lot already priced into the market and TSLA basically in capitulation mode.  Also, of course, AAPL could always break the $130 resistance and drop a considerable amount, but somehow, AAPL always seems to surprise on earnings and this could be the turn around the market has been looking for; hence, I feel VIGIX will come back a considerable amount this year.

For the company match, which should be around $8-9K, I'm torn between a 50/50 split of FXAIX (can't go wrong with S&amp;P 500) and VIGIX or 50/50 split with FXAIX and Vanguard Value Index VVIAX.  VVIAX is only down roughly 5.0% for the year and has shown serious strength (same as the DOW) but I've never really been a value stock investor and don't have too much knowledge on how they tend to perform in current economic conditions and long term outlook.  Would it be worth starting a potential steady and modest value index play or try to catch the rebound with growth?

Appreciate any and all feedback.","sup friends. year ending dividends/capital gains/401k company match (100% 8% salary $110k/year), looking change future contributions move money around well see everyone's 2023 outlook possibly thumbs up/down plan below. current break fidelity 401k ratios is: fidelity 500 index (fxaix) -- 45.25% -- ytd: -18.03% vanguard growth index (vigix) -- 33.90% -- ytd: -32.97% fidelity freedom 2050 k6 (fztkx) -- 20.85% -- ytd: -18.00% fztkx pays dividends/capital gains 12/30/22. thinking closing fztkx moving vigix basically oct/nov lows feeling worst behind us lot already priced market tsla basically capitulation mode. also, course, aapl could always break $130 resistance drop considerable amount, somehow, aapl always seems surprise earnings could turn around market looking for; hence, feel vigix come back considerable amount year. company match, around $8-9k, torn 50/50 split fxaix (can't go wrong sp 500) vigix 50/50 split fxaix vanguard value index vviax. vviax roughly 5.0% year shown serious strength (same dow) never really value stock investor much knowledge tend perform current economic conditions long term outlook. would worth starting potential steady modest value index play try catch rebound growth? appreciate feedback.","['VIGIX', 'Vanguard Value Index', 'Fidelity 401K', 'Oct/Nov', 'Tesla', 'Apple']"

Tesla is now trading at $106 AH.

 I noticed just a few small differences...

* Musk liquidates billions in stock to buy Twitter
* Elon saying that he will sell BILLIONS MORE stock in 2025 or sooner
* Fed raising interest rates will hurt auto industry as a whole
* Tesla has a few more factories, Germany can't hire anyone due to uncompetitive compensation compared to other German auto makers, while Tesla is planning layoffs in US factories and temporary shutdown in China
* Elon thinks supporting alt-right will suddenly become environmentalists and embrace EV's instead of their redneck coal-rollers
* Elon thinks supporting Republicans will get him more EV support programs from Congress
* Consumer Reports rating Tesla as WORST in build quality (at a time when...)
* Legacy automakers catching up (Hyundai EV just won highest 5 star safety rating European standards) and have decades of established quality manufacturing standards
* Unpredictable Russia Ukraine war
* Higher labor costs
* Higher raw materials costs
* Chip shortage
* Higher logistics costs
* Musk alienating his first to adopt audience turning them against Tesla causing enough decline in demand that even $7500 off sale and 3x markdowns in China can't fix
* Tesla opened up charging network to nab some capital from government grants but shooting themselves in the foot at the same time
* A little thing called GLOBAL RECESSION

Tesla's record PE was 192.  They're sitting at about 30.  Industry average is about 6.

&gt; Stock futures climbed fractionally Wednesday morning as traders look to the end of a losing year and prepare for 2023.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 91 points, or 0.27%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.25% and 0.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors will look for insights into the state of the economy in manufacturing data from the Richmond Federal Reserve and pending home sales coming Wednesday morning. Market participants will be looking for numbers that can signal the economy is cooling, which they hope could indicate to the Fed that interest rate hikes can continue slowing.
*****
&gt; Tuesday kicked off the start of a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow rose 37.63 points, or 0.11%, to close at 33,241.56. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.40%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite shed nearly 1.4%, driven down by an 11% drop in Tesla stock after The Wall Street Journal reported that the electric vehicle maker would continue a weeklong production pause at a Shanghai facility. Tuesday marked the seventh straight day of losses for the stock.
*****
&gt; It comes at the end of a tumultuous year for the electric-vehicle maker as owner Elon Musk executed a chaotic purchase of Twitter. Tesla’s share value is down 69% this year.
*****
&gt; “A year ago, Musk was a hero and there was panic buying to the upside,” said Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, on “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “Right now ... it’s panic selling.”
*****
&gt; With three trading days left in 2022, the stock market is on track for its worst year since 2008. The Nasdaq has performed the worst of the three indexes, losing 33.8% this year as investors rotated out of growth stocks amid rising recession fears. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on track to lose 8.5% and 19.7%, respectively.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures rose on Wednesday night, as investors head into the final trading days of 2022.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the broad market index gained 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged higher by 76 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, traders are expecting the latest data on weekly jobless claims before the bell. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are forecasting initial jobless claims to total 223,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, a rise from 216,000 during the previous period.
*****
&gt; The futures action follows a broad sell-off during the regular session Wednesday as recession fears weighed on investor sentiment in a losing week, month and year. The Dow lost 365.85 points, or 1.1%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.35%.
*****
&gt; The major averages are headed toward their worst year since 2008. The Dow has lost 9.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 shed 20.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq is the worst performer, down 34.7% as investors dumped growth stocks.
*****
&gt; “Investors are anticipating an economic recession to materialize early in 2023, as evidenced by the three quarters of projected S&amp;P 500 earnings declines and continued defensive sector leanings,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, wrote in a Wednesday note. “The severity of the recession remains in question. We expect it to be mild.”

**1. September 13 - S&amp;P 500 down 4.3%**

The stock market had its worst day of the year after the August consumer price index report showed inflation running hotter than expected, at 8.3% year-over-year compared to expectations of 8.0%.

  **2. May 18 - S&amp;P 500 down 4.0%** 

A big earnings miss from Target highlighted shifts in consumer spending patterns, supply chain issues, and rising input costs. This was just one day after Walmart warned investors about the same issues. Target closed down 25% that day.

**3. June 13 - S&amp;P 500 down 3.9%**

**4. April 29 - S&amp;P 500 down 3.6%**

1672368842,4,"A lot of people here don't use borrowed money to invest, but simply pick the stocks you invest in. This sounds safe, but in fact you may be getting a return akin to using leverage without realizing it. The fact is a lot of the most popular stocks have borrowed heavily to expand their operations. You may think that all stocks entail equal risk, but clearly that is not so.

An excellent example of this is ARK Invest. They invest almost exclusively in ""disruptive technology."" That is new firms with new products to bring to market. What does that mean? ALL HAVE LOTS OF DEBT. Ergo some do well and expand quickly, others don't and default. This is why ARK Invest products seem to have returns akin to a leveraged S&amp;P fund, but not the day to day volatility. Part of the reason for the lack of volatility is the amount of private equity ARK invested in and those don't have the instant valuation changes public firms do.

What does this mean? Well, you may have two otherwise identical firms, except one borrows heavily to expand operations and the other doesn't. Ergo, the return of the one will behave like a leveraged investment into the other.

I will ask you to look at what you're holding, examine their debt outstanding, and ask yourself how ""safe"" your investment style really is. Some of you here are using margin and options to gain leverage, and so you must factor that in to the true overall leverage. In the real world, Ford has a debt to income ratio of \~1.5x, and Tesla has a debt to income ratio of \~3.6x, ergo Tesla is more risky than Ford. And both companies make electric vehicles with Ford promising to go all electric in the coming years.

To the extent shares are not equal can be shown by how borrowing to invest in a safe stock may net more returns than an unlevered investment into risky stock. There's no guarantee of this, but the best returns are always the ones disproportionate to risks taken.

Yes, margin, corporate debt, naked options, student loans, mortgages, and all the rest of it is all just leverage. Some of these are normalized and expected, others are considered exotic and risky, but it's all the same thing.","lot people use borrowed money invest, simply pick stocks invest in. sounds safe, fact may getting return akin using leverage without realizing it. fact lot popular stocks borrowed heavily expand operations. may think stocks entail equal risk, clearly so. excellent example ark invest. invest almost exclusively ""disruptive technology."" new firms new products bring market. mean? lots debt. ergo well expand quickly, others default. ark invest products seem returns akin leveraged sp fund, day day volatility. part reason lack volatility amount private equity ark invested instant valuation changes public firms do. mean? well, may two otherwise identical firms, except one borrows heavily expand operations doesn't. ergo, return one behave like leveraged investment other. ask look holding, examine debt outstanding, ask ""safe"" investment style really is. using margin options gain leverage, must factor true overall leverage. real world, ford debt income ratio \~1.5x, tesla debt income ratio \~3.6x, ergo tesla risky ford. companies make electric vehicles ford promising go electric coming years. extent shares equal shown borrowing invest safe stock may net returns unlevered investment risky stock. there's guarantee this, best returns always ones disproportionate risks taken. yes, margin, corporate debt, naked options, student loans, mortgages, rest leverage. normalized expected, others considered exotic risky, thing.","['ARK Invest', 'Ford', '\\~3.6x', 'ARK', 'Tesla']"

#[Stock futures edge lower as Wall Street awaits final trading day of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures edged lower in premarket trading Friday as investors braced for the final trading day of the worst year for stocks since 2008.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 130 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 0.6% and nearly 0.9%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The overnight moves followed a rally Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 climbing about 2.6% and roughly 1.8%, respectively. The Dow jumped 345 points, or 1.05%.
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P are slightly higher, with the Nasdaq on track for a modest loss. All major averages are lower for December and are poised to snap a two-month win streak.
*****
&gt; Friday marks the final day of trading of what’s been a painful year for stocks. A volatile bear market, sticky inflation, and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks. These factors also weighed on investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; All three of the major averages are marching toward their worst year since 2008, slated to snap a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down 8.58%, while the S&amp;P and tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 19.24% and 33.03%, respectively.
*****
&gt; As the calendar year turns the corner, some investors think the pain is far from over, and expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows.
*****
&gt; “We’re sort of stuck in neutral right now, because there are more unanswered questions than there are known entities. ... We’ve got a lot riding on this coming earnings season, when we think about the pressures that are going to exist on margins,” Rebecca Felton, senior market strategist at Riverfront Investment Group, said on “Squawk Box.”
*****
&gt; “There are a lot of questions as we head into the new year, but we certainly will be happy to see 2022 go over,” Felton added.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow is on pace for a 15.65% quarterly gain and is primed to snap a three-quarter losing streak. It’s also headed for its best quarter since the second quarter of 2020. The S&amp;P is up 7.35% and slated to break three consecutive quarterly losses. The Nasdaq’s slipped 0.92%, for its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001.
*****
&gt; All major S&amp;P sectors finished Thursday with gains, led to the upside by communication services. For the quarter, consumer discretionary and communication services are the only sectors headed for losses. Energy is the only sector on pace for yearly gains after surging nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; Communication services stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are down more than 40% on the year and consumer discretionary has fallen 37.4%, while energy, the large-cap index’s only positive sector, has soared nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, Chicago PMI data for December is due out Friday. Next week will see a slightly more active slate for economic data, highlighted by the nonfarm payrolls report set for Jan. 6. Financial markets are closed Monday in observance of the New Year’s Day holiday.

1672427878,90,"Well, it took a bit, but finally here's my full analysis of Tesla.

***Disclaimer: I have a small position in Tesla with an average price of around $150/share.***

The post covers the following:

1. Introduction
2. Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.
3. Competitive landscape (profitability, debt &amp; future growth/ROIC)
4. Historical financial performance
5. Assumptions &amp; valuation
6. Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

I'd describe Tesla as a car company with big dreams and impressive technology. There are bulls and bears with different assumptions about the future, but if we look backward, there's no doubt that as a company, it disrupted the industry and accelerated the transition to EVs.

It operates in two segments, automotive (responsible for 96% of the revenue and almost all the gross profit) and energy generation and storage (attributing the remaining 4% of the revenue).

Now, I mentioned big dreams. That's of course, coming from Elon Musk. Let's take a look at a few of them:

1. FSD (Full self-driving capability) &amp; robotaxis - Tesla was to some extent the first mover in this area and is likely the company with the most data. However, in my opinion, the competitors are catching up. As for the robotaxis, there's still some time until it becomes a reality and when it happens, Tesla won't be the only player on the market.
2. The ""energy generation and storage"" segment is to be worth as much as the automotive segment - Another big prediction that so far seems to have an incredibly low probability. Its current size is insignificant, it's not a profitable segment, and in order to become a significant portion of Tesla's value, well, it will take a long time.
3. Optimus - The humanoid robot is expected to be on sale by 2027 with a cost of $20k. This was revealed on the latest AI day and some engineers who followed the event (and are not employed at Tesla) weren't impressed. They weren't impressed by the current state of Optimus, although they were impressed by the progress made in such a short period of time.
4. Tesla will sell 20m cars annually by 2030 - This is something that we'll come back to.

One of the jobs of Elon Musk, like any other CEO, is to be positive and optimistic about the future. That doesn't mean everything will happen nor that the timeline is accurate (especially with Elon).

There are 110k employees at Tesla, yet the tweets of one of them seem to have more impact on the share price compared to all the work the others do. It seems as if Elon has shifted from being one of Tesla's biggest assets to one of its biggest liabilities. However, this post will not be about Elon, it will focus on Tesla as a company and its fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.**

Let's zoom out for a moment. It is obvious that there's a lot of stuff going on (and who knows what else will be announced in the next decade), so in my forecast, I'm expecting that the automotive segment will account for 90% of Tesla's value, leaving 10% for all the other stuff (Optimus, energy generation and storage, etc.)

To value any car company, there are two main inputs:

1. \# of cars sold annually
2. Margin per car

For younger car companies, capacity is also something to be looked into.

If we look at the statistics, the number of cars sold worldwide annually is pretty flat over time.

2019: **74.9m;** 2020: **63.8m;** 2021: **66.7m;** 2022: **65.4m;** 2023: **71.0m (expected)**

We can round that to 70m cars/year.

Tesla has been growing quite fast when it comes to deliveries

2018: **245k;** 2019: **367k**; 2020: **499k;** 2021: **936k;** 2022: **1.4m (expected - rounded)**

So, based on the 2022 numbers, Tesla has roughly a 2% share.

If we go back at the 20m cars/year prediction, that represents a staggering **28.5% share!** How realistic is that? Well, I'll let you be the judge.

How about the production capacity? Currently, that's around **1.9m**. So, if Tesla wants to grow, they need to invest here A LOT. How much? Let's take a look at their historical investments:

The Berlin factory cost around $5b and comes with a capacity of 250k cars. So, on average, Tesla would need to invest around $20k in capex to increase the production capacity by 1 car. Using the gross PPE from the balance sheet as a metric for all past investments ($43.9b) that led to the 1.9m capacity, we get to a similar outcome. Of course, not all of the $43.9b is related to manufacturing, there's a portion for R&amp;D, general support functions, etc.

This gives a good idea of the future investments required. If Tesla wants to increase capacity by 4m units, they need to invest roughly $80b.

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitive landscape**

In this segment, I'd like to take a look at 10+ competitors in this industry and look into quite some metrics. I'll start with what the critics normally point out, the price of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Revenue (in $b)|Market cap (in $b)|P/E ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$74.9|$381.7|36.5|
|Toyota|$232.2|$188.6|10.0|
|BYD|$47.6|$96.3|51.0|
|Volkswagen|$261.2|$71.9|3.6|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$141.4|$70.7|5.1|
|BMW|$128.9|$58.9|3.1|
|General Motors|$147.2|$47.8|5.7|
|Ford|$151.8|$46.4|5.2|
|Stellantis|$172.7|$46.1|2.8|
|Honda|$108.1|$38.8|7.9|

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla's P/E is roughly 7x higher than the average of the competitors (with a few exceptions). The question that is asked over and over is, how the hell is Tesla worth so much more than Toyota when Toyota sells 10m cars a year (with Tesla 1.4m for the full 2022)? To answer that question, we need to look into 3 segments:

1. Profitability
2. Debt
3. Future growth/ROIC

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's start with profitability:**

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Revenue (in $b)|Gross profit|Operating expenses|Operating margin|Operating profit (in $m)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$74.9|26.6%|9.9%|16.7%|$12,510|
|Toyota|$232.2|17.0%|9.9%|7.1%|$16,511|
|BYD|$47.6|15.1%|11.8%|3.3%|$1,547|
|Volkswagen|$261.2|18.5%|10.2%|8.3%|$21,555|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$141.4|22.5%|11.0%|11.5%|$16,279|
|BMW|$128.9|16.5%|6.6%|9.9%|$13,079|
|General Motors|$147.2|13.6%|5.4%|8.2%|$12,025|
|Ford|$151.8|11.4%|4.3%|7.1%|$10,696|
|Stellantis|$172.7|20.2%|8.5%|11.7%|$20,173|
|Honda|$108.1|20.0%|14.4%|5.6%|$6,097|

The companies are sorted based on their market cap. Although Tesla has 1/3rd of Toyota's revenue, they make almost as much operating profit! Why? It's obvious, they have higher margins. So, what contributes to that? A few points have to be noted:

1. Tesla does not sell through dealerships - this allows them to have higher gross margins as there are no 3rd parties to pay.
2. Tesla famously doesn't spend money on marketing (funny enough, Elon bought a company that depends on advertising, but anyway, let's get back to Tesla)
3. Tesla could build factories from scratch, perfectly suited for EVs, while the big companies have to invest to re-purpose their existing factories.

There are only two luxury cars that have higher operating margins than Tesla (Porsche &amp; Ferrari), but they're targeting a very niche audience and not the mass-market.

**Let's continue by looking at the debt of each company:**

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Operating profit (in $m)|Market cap (in $b)|Net debt (in $b)|Market cap + Net debt (EV)|EV / Operating profit|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$12,510|$381.7|$ (15.2)|$366.5|29.3|
|Toyota|$16,511|$188.6|$143.6|$332.2|20.1|
|BYD|$1,547|$96.3|$ (3.0)|$93.3|60.3|
|Volkswagen|$21,555|$71.9|$157.0|$228.9|10.6|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$16,279|$70.7|$95.1|$165.7|10.2|
|BMW|$13,079|$58.9|$83.3|$142.2|10.9|
|General Motors|$12,025|$47.8|$89.2|$137.0|11.4|
|Ford|$10,696|$46.4|$97.8|$144.2|13.5|
|Stellantis|$20,173|$46.1|$ (20.1)|$26.0|1.3|
|Honda|$6,097|$38.8|$28.3|$67.1|11.0|

Why is looking at the debt so important? Well:

1. First of all, it isn't free. It needs to be repaid and with interest. The auto industry is known to be cyclical, but the debt doesn't really care about that.
2. The companies that are better positioned from a financial leverage perspective can afford to lower prices temporarily and steal market share. Tesla is in a great position for this, while the giants cannot afford to break even (from an operating profit point of view)
3. High leverage combined with unprofitable business leads to bankruptcy.

So, I decided to look at this a bit differently. I wanted to check how much would one pay to acquire each company debt-free and what is the return (measured through operating profit). Now, Tesla's ratio isn't 7x higher, but less than 3x higher than the average competitor.

Remember Toyota? It needs 9 years of operating profit to cover its net debt! Tesla costs 367m to be bought debt-free, while Toyota 332m - quite close!

P.S. I took a shortcut for the EV calculation, it's not 100% accurate (it doesn't take into account minority interest, for example), but it's quite close.

**Lastly, let's take a look at the last piece of the puzzle, the growth &amp; ROIC**

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Operating profit (in $m)|EV / Operating profit|NTM revenue growth|ROIC|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$12,510|29.3|45.0%|26.4%|
|Toyota|$16,511|20.1|14.5%|4.0%|
|BYD|$1,547|60.3|46.7%|7.9%|
|Volkswagen|$21,555|10.6|5.8%|6.0%|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$16,279|10.2|3.5%|8.7%|
|BMW|$13,079|10.9|6.5%|7.0%|
|General Motors|$12,025|11.4|9.4%|6.5%|
|Ford|$10,696|13.5|5.9%|6.2%|
|Stellantis|$20,173|1.3|4.0%|19.5%|
|Honda|$6,097|11.0|24.0%|4.1%|

It's obvious that Tesla and BYD are the exceptions when we look at the expected revenue growth for the next 12 months.

However, what's also impressive is that Tesla has the highest ROIC - They're making the best return on their investments. All of that while also spending money on all kinds of side projects.

In my opinion, the culture within Tesla seems to be better suited for innovation, compared to the old-school, traditional, car manufacturers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

Tesla's revenue has increased significantly, from $21.5b back in 2018 to almost $80b in the last twelve months. At the same time, the gross margin increased from 19% to almost 27%.

The operating expenses (R&amp;D and SG&amp;A) have decreased as % of sales from 20% to 10%, leading to an operating margin of 17%, which is much higher than the average.

Over the same period, they reduced their debt from $14b to $6b (while accumulating $21b+ in cash) leading to a net debt position of -$15b.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions &amp; valuation**

As mentioned above, I'm expecting that the automotive segment will account for 90% of Tesla's value, leaving 10% for all the other stuff (Optimus, energy generation and storage, etc.)

My assumptions are as follows:

**Revenue growth**: 35% in the next 12 months, declining to 30%, then to 25%, all the way down to 5% in year 10. By then, the projected revenue is close to **$400b (an increase of 431% vs. LTM)** \- representing roughly 6m cars per year (8.6% share) - This also means $80b in capex over time (4m additional capacity x $20k)

Just a reminder of how Tesla's deliveries have progressed over time:

2018: **245k;** 2019: **367k**; 2020: **499k;** 2021: **936k;** 2022: **1.4m (expected - rounded)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Operating margin**: 10% for the next 2 years due to a recession, then recovery to 18% over time.

**Discount rate:** 9.5%

**Terminal growth rate:** 5%

The valuation based on my assumptions is **$563b** **(179.84/share)**

&amp;#x200B;

***Note: Adjustments have been made for cash/debt, unearned revenue as well as outstanding equity options***

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before anyone jumps on me, these are my assumptions and I could be significantly wrong. So, if you have other expectations, I hope the table below can help.

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

The table below shows how the valuation changes (per share), based on assumptions regarding the revenue in 10 years, the operating margin, and how the market share / # of cars to be sold to get there.

|Revenue/ Operating margin|16%|18%|20%|22%|Cars/year (share %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|250% ($262.0b)|$109.5|$125.2|$139.2|$152.2|3.5m (5%)|
|325% ($318.1b)|$129.5|$148.4|$165.5|$181.2|4.5m (6.5%)|
|431% (397.4b)|$156.3|$179.8|$201.1|$220.8|6m (8.6)|
|1670% (1.33t)|$445.6|$519.3|$589.2|$654.8|20m (28.5%)|

The last row represents Elon Musk's crazy scenario of selling 20m+ cars per year (without even taking into account the energy generation and storage segment to be the same size as the automotive one) For that to happen, Tesla needs to grow at a rate of 35% annually for a decade.

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is undervalued at the current price levels, however, it was significantly overvalued for a long period of time.

I hope you enjoyed the post and apologies for the length, I wanted to make sure to cover all the points that I find important.

**The Strategy**

My strategy is based upon a concentrated value investing approach. I like to perform deep fundamental research to find and buy a stake in companies that I find value in. I like to hold 12 to 15 stocks diversified among various industries to diversify against any black swan events. This strategy offers my portfolio enough downside protection while also leaving enough room for my best ideas to play out. I protect the portfolio from serious losses by performing deep fundamental research and by using a margin of safety, not by avoiding or minimizing volatility. I see stocks as parts of businesses and analyze and value them according to that principle. This includes both buying low and buying the companies with a high discount to their intrinsic value. When you minimize losses and allocate capital when the odds are in your favor, you don’t lose and when you win, you win big. That is the backbone of a concentrated value approach.

I do not hold restrictions on portfolio management and can allocate a larger part of my portfolio to one or several stocks. I furthermore do not yield any restrictions to potential investments. Such restrictions harm the ability to invest freely and to fully deploy my strategy and can even diminish performance. This includes market caps, industries, ESG restrictions, portfolio sizes, number of stocks and country of origin. I hold 12-15 stocks because I like it that way, it leaves enough room for opportunities while making sure you deeply understand both your investments and your entire portfolio. I allocate capital based upon a risk/reward scenario whereas all positions (and sizes) are constructed according to that principle. If the numbers are simply too good, I may allocate more capital to that opportunity, certainly if the risk is contained or minimized towards the downside. 

**Volatility**

Basic mathematical principles tell us that to maximize our upside returns, firstly we need to minimize the downside as lost dollars are harder to replace (i.e. a 33% drop needs a 50% gain to breakeven). I do not hedge the portfolio with various instruments as hedging is surrendering towards the idea that you are unsure about your portfolio and individual positions. I hold securities and maintain a decent cash position to allocate capital to various opportunities presented by the market without the need to sell off other positions. Trying to avoid losses is done by deeply fundamental research and buying stocks cheaply and not by hedging your uncertain positions by buying various financial instruments. One could argue that buying dollar bills for 50 cents and therefore stocks that are cheaply priced towards their intrinsic value is all the hedging an equity portfolio requires.

I do not think that volatility is related to risk or risk of losses and the portfolio is therefore not constructed to minimize volatility. Each investor should understand that a concentrated value approach yields an above average high level of volatility and should not confuse volatility with risk (as is common in modern day finance). Again, risk is minimized not through building statistical models regarding volatility but rather through respectful and deep business evaluation and research. Traditional risk management considers beta, also known as market risk, as a measure of volatility or systematic risk of an individual stock in comparison to the entire market. According to that idea, risk management would therefore be appropriate to diversify in a lot of stocks to smooth out volatility and still be rewarded with an appropriate return. If you include enough stocks to eventually resemble the index volatility, then your returns will eventually resemble the index that you are so desperately trying to beat and doom yourself to mediocre performance. Deep business evaluation and research is ought to be useless as the efficient market assigns the correct values to all businesses. The entire finance industry operates mainly to the same models and therefore increases the volatility and opportunities presented by the market, so volatility can also be a tool to buy a good stock for a high discount relative to its intrinsic value.

**Warren Buffet:** ""The riskiness of an investment is not measured by beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by the probability of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing power over his contemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably certain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period."" (2011)

**The Portfolio**

I try to stay away from the most popular stock in the most popular industry. I do not assign any indicative value towards securities other than the value I find in them by performing deep fundamental research. I do not allocate capital towards businesses simply because they are popular, well-known, would make the portfolio look great on paper or are fun to talk about on your nephew’s birthday party. Peter Lynch prefers to avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry; stocks that are heralded as the next big something; longshot companies at the cusp of solving the latest national problem; and stocks with the most exciting name. He also dislikes whisper stocks that attract imaginative, complicated, and emotionally appealing stories. Stocks that receive significant positive attention have greater risk of being over-bought and over-priced. High growth businesses in popular industries with low barrier to entry attracts a lot of competition and imitation. I tend to agree with him.

To the contrary, my strategy may well be exactly the opposite: I try to find beaten down unpopular undervalued stocks in disfavored industries. For these stocks the downward risk most of the times already happened, there is high emotion involved and some stories are not fully understood. These turnaround stories also have the highest potential for increases in returns. I focus on companies based upon EV/EBITDA ratio since I believe that to be a better measure of profitability and the value assigned to a company. I furthermore focus on free cash flow as that provides businesses opportunities to deploy their capital and achieve shareholder returns. I like companies that are buying back shares and have management that is shareholder friendly oriented. I furthermore like ''rare bird'' stocks that offer special stories and opportunities such as spinoffs, asset plays, arbitrage opportunities and turnarounds because of the asymmetric risk/reward ratio involved. Some companies are so cheaply priced that there seems almost no further downside risk to that specific scenario. I furthermore like companies with recent catalysts that would make it hard to analyze and value the company correctly such as mergers, scandals or trouble, therefore creating opportunities for the observant investor. I calculate and adjust the financial statements to recent situations to derive at my fair value of the company which most of the time is not in line with the price attached to the company by the market.  

I hold my positions for the long term if the fundamentals of the stock stay the same or improve. I sell when my profit target (value) is reached. Although my potential profit could be higher when I hold on just a little longer, in the entire history of humanity, no one has ever gone broke taking profits. If the company does change fundamentally or they don’t show good prospects, I close the position and look for new opportunities. Investing requires both ‘’science and art’’ from the individual investor to form his qualified opinion and specific investment actions. The more qualitative ‘art’ of investing is hard to explicitly state on paper and although I love to elaborate further about the portfolio selection criteria, I think those are best explained below by the current holdings in our portfolio.

**2023 Outlook**

The past year saw a moderate decline in stock prices and the market decline has created greater opportunities among undervalued situations with positive long-term outlook for potential returns. I specifically use the word ‘moderate’ since casual reading of recent media outlets would suggest that the decline is much greater. One could argue to be ‘greedy when others are fearful’ as we saw a lot of fear in the market in the past year. This does not, however, suggest that the market is unable to decline more and create both further investment losses and bargain situations in the stock market. As I do not attempt to forecast stock prices in the short or medium term, I have no idea whether broad market indexes will rise, fall or go sideways for the upcoming year, period or decade. Although past performance is no guarantee for future results, it is a rather useful indicator because the one constant in financial markets is human nature and human nature can be highly emotional, volatile and irrational. If you would compare the 2022 bear market with historical bear markets this would suggest more pain ahead but then again the economic situation and outlook may well be different from those economic situations in the past that accompanied historic market drawdowns.

I do think that the short-term outlook is rather negative across financial markets and that such negative outlooks in the past have been good moments for opportunities in the markets. I furthermore think that our portfolio is well suited for potential long-term returns and potential short-term volatility.  We hold a decent cash allocation in the portfolio to buy a) any of the undervalued opportunities Mr. Market presents to us or b) to increase our positions in our current holdings. 

I do not pretend to be able to predict market movements in the short-term and would feel that any energy used in this endeavor would take energy away from my main tasks. I rather spend my energy looking at the investment opportunities not the condition of the general market itself. That will be our 2023 strategy. Please consider that our concentrated equity portfolio is one of high volatility and act accordingly. I personally have invested a large part of my net worth in the Fund and I hold no other equity securities. My entire professional focus is in this Eurykleia Fund and I therefore believe our goals and returns to be aligned. 

**Our Current Portfolio**

Our portfolio currently consists of 12 marketable securities that are discussed in more detail individually below. I believe all holdings to be undervalued and for that reason have included them in the portfolio. Traditional risk management would suggest that our portfolio contains a high level of risk since it is not diversified into many stocks. In fact, traditional risk management is right in the fact that this portfolio has a high level of market volatility but is wrong in assuming that volatility is in any way related to risk. I do not include company A because I also hold company B and consequently pretend that that addition to the portfolio would in any way decrease the portfolio risk of serious investment losses. To the contrary, adding various random businesses without the deep fundamental research required upfront just for the sake of ‘diversification’ would only worsen the portfolio outlook and increase the risk of serious losses. 

The portfolio is structured and prepared for a wide variety of potential economic situations in the upcoming year. All of our holdings are cash flow generating businesses that generate a high stream of free cash flow and do not depend upon the interest rates dictated by central banks for their growth and survival. We hold 15% of our portfolio in cash to take advantage of opportunities provided to us by the market. 

We have allocated 25% of our capital to **Brookfield Corporation** and **Brookfield Asset Management** since there is value to be found in both businesses due to their recent spinoff of the asset manager. We hold 16% of our portfolio in two oil and gas producers (**Ovintiv** and **Diamondback Energy**) as the low allocation of capital in the industry and the shareholder friendly attitude of management provides opportunities for the coming period. We have furthermore some exposures to retail businesses that may be impacted by a dooming recession but a) these businesses together make up only 15% of the portfolio and b) these businesses are priced so cheaply that they are priced for a suggested bankruptcy instead of a potential recession.

**Brookfield Corporation (14.86%)**

Brookfield is a Canadian alternative asset manager that currently has over $750 billion assets under management across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power and transition, private equity, and credit. Brookfield furthermore holds equity investments in both their own investment funds and subsidiary businesses of $35 billion as well as a sizeable amount of $125 billion cash that can be deployed in their funds and the markets. They have grown their funds from operations annually by 15%. The recent downturn in the market means that they both must adjust the fair value of their investments to market prices and have more cheaper opportunities to deploy their vast amount of capital. More recently, they have distributed 25% of their asset management businesses towards shareholders in a recent spinoff. The Corporation, post spinoff, will own circa $150 billion of private and listed investments, including a 75% interest in the newly listed Manager. 

Brookfield is known for building high growing businesses from scratch and eventually deploying them on the equity markets. They have done so successfully with their asset manager. Currently they are already building their next high profitable and strongly growing business: Brookfield Insurance Solutions which contributed with increased earnings to the distributable earnings that have grown by 39%. By holding our shares in the corporation, we own a claim on the profits received from all businesses owned by the corporation and we participate in the growth of all underlying businesses as well (such as the insurance solutions).

**Brookfield Asset Management (10.72%)**

Brookfield Asset Management has recently spinoff from Brookfield Corporation and is therefore a rather new company.  The manager earnings are based on the fees they receive on their invested capital as well as their portion fees of the investment profits (carried interest). The manager has grown their fee bearing capital from $141 billion in 2018 towards $407 billion in 2022 and AUM has grown by 19% YoY, or $66 billion. Their fee-related earnings have therefore also grown from $823 million in 2018 towards $2 billion in 2022 and have grown 21% YoY, or $352 million. 83% of their fee-bearing capital is long-dated or perpetual. Currently the manager is expected to pay a quarterly (annual) dividend of $0.32 ($1.28) which amounts to a dividend yield of 4.5%. Management furthermore expects their earnings to double in 2027 and to pay 90% of their earnings as a dividend. This means that in 5 years’ time at the current market price the dividend yield would be 9% as well as their earnings to double. Furthermore, the asset manager is able to buy investments at cheap prices and can demand bargain deals for private equity deals. Please notice that the corporation holds 75% of the shares of the manager and therefore receives a $1.37 billion dividend in 2022 alone, or 2.66% of their market cap of $51 billion (the corporation). We own the asset manager because we want to profit from our stake in a highly growing business that has successfully shown in the past that they are able to even outperform their own estimations.

**Ovintiv (9.40%)**

Ovintiv Inc. is a Canadian energy company that is engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. The company is focused on unconventional oil and natural gas resources, including shale, tight oil, and tight gas. Ovintiv is one of the largest oil and natural gas producers in Canada and is also active in the Permian Basin in the United States. The company certainly looks undervalued with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 3.19, a free cash flow yield of 14.5% and return on equity of 71.25%. The company has focused on paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders. They have decreased their net debt from $4.6 billion to $3.6 billion in 2022 and have the approval to buyback 25 million shares (or 10% of their shares outstanding). Investors might stay away from oil companies because of the fear of a recession and the accompanying drop in oil prices, but even when oil prices drop to crude at $65, the company guides to free cash flow generation of $11B over the next 5 years. In other words, there’s a good shot the company will return nearly its entire market cap to shareholders over the next 5 years.

**Qurate Retail Group (8.08%)**

Qurate Retail Group is a multinational company that owns and operates several retail brands, including QVC, HSN, Zulily, and Ballard Designs. The company is known for its focus on home shopping and e-commerce and Qurate Retail Group's brands offer a wide range of products, including apparel, home goods, beauty products, and electronics. YTD the stock dropped 78.89% towards a market cap of $652 million with a 10-year average of $1 billion free cash flow. Several negative issues such as a fire in a distribution facility, decreasing revenue, a high annual loss and recession fears have pushed the expectation of future profitability towards new low levels. The company, however, is paying down debt at an increasing rate and could buyback their debt on a discount due to rising interest rates. Furthermore, if the company can even come close to their average of $1 billion free cash flow, they can buyback their stock and retire nearly their entire market cap in one year. Since the stock has decreased significantly, it now offers a high margin of safety and a high upside opportunity. The company is currently valued at bankruptcy levels. If the company is able to only use a $100 million of free cash flow to buy back their own stock, they can retire 15% of their outstanding shares. Qurate Retail could be one of those rare turnaround opportunities that provide limited further downside risk and substantial potential upside returns.

**Geo Group (7.09%)**

The GEO Group, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides government-outsourced services, primarily in the field of corrections, detention, and mental health treatment. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. The GEO Group operates detention centers, prisons, and mental health facilities in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The company contracts with various government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and state and local governments. Due to the government contracts that have a retention rate of 91%, the revenues and cash flows are highly constant and predictable. The company is furthermore paying of their debt and has a highly growing electronic monitoring business unit that has grown by 74% in the past year. The Geo Group is a real estate owner that records all their PPE at ‘at cost basis’ and therefore highly understates their balance sheet assets which consists for 50% of buildings. The company is growing their revenue and margins and has access to 82.000 correction beds across 102 facilities; The beds are currently valued as if the facilities are idle but the beds have an occupation rate of 85%. The Geo Group seems the perfect value play for the coming year since there is little downside risk of serious losses and there are several positive catalysts coming together.

**Diamondback Energy (6.62%)**

Diamondback Energy, Inc. is a publicly traded American oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is headquartered in Midland, Texas and is focused on the acquisition, development, and exploration of unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The company was founded in 2007 and went public in 2012. Diamondback Energy is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas producers in the Permian Basin and is known for its focus on using advanced technology and data analytics to optimize its operations. With a dividend yield of 6.56%, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 4.19 and a free cash flow yield of 13% the company seems highly undervalued. The general investment thesis surrounding oil companies is comparable to that of Ovintiv but Diamondback Energy carries less debt than Ovintiv, adds geographic diversification of revenues and is focused on improving free cash flows by performing strategic acquisitions. The acquisitions can be highly rewardable due to the low values of the industry assets and businesses. As long as oil prices remain elevated, so also the share price of Diamondback Energy.

**Activision Blizzard (5.86%)**

Microsoft has offered to buy Activision Blizzard for $95 per share in a transaction that is expected to complete in June 2023. With the current share price of $76 this amounts to a potential 25% return in 6 months. Although we believe that the deal will go through there is always uncertainty with arbitrage opportunities and we therefore have allocated only 5% of our portfolio towards this arbitrage play. We furthermore believe the downside risk to be minimal which contributes to the investment thesis.

**Warner Bros. Discovery (5.11%)**

Warner Bros. is down from a share price of $31 towards a current share price of $9.40, or a 70% decrease in price YTD. The company is struggling with the recent merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery and incurs high merger costs as well as depreciation and amortization that have been a downward pressure on its profitability. Investors are worried about the seemingly high amount of $47 billion debt. The company, however, has shown strong cash flows and is able to pay off their debt on a discount due to recent rising interest rates. For example, in the past two quarters the company paid off $6 billion of their debt with their cash flows. The CEO has great experience in the media industry and with turning around a media company. Although there are several problems within Warner Bros. Discovery, we believe the pessimism to be overstated and we expect a turnaround when the company can control their merger costs and regain profitability.

**F&amp;G Annuities &amp; Life (4.79%)**

F&amp;G is a nationwide market leader for insurance solutions to retail annuity and life customers and institutional clients. The company has recently spinoff from parent company Fidelity National Financial and currently has a market cap of $380 million and a 4% dividend yield. They have grown their assets under management by 21% YoY towards $42 billion (which were $28.6 billion in 2020). The U.S. retirement and middle markets are growing, and F&amp;G is well-positioned for continued growth in their retail and institutional channels. F&amp;G has diverse product lines and have grown revenue with significant above industry growth numbers (sales grown 15% YoY). Recently, F&amp;G reached an inflection point where they expect to start distributing a portion of their adjusted net earnings to shareholders over time, subject to F&amp;G board of directors’ approval. YTD Q3 their net income was $581 million and their adjusted net earnings were $207 million. For the past 9 quarters, they managed to earn $100 million adjusted net earnings. Given the fact that F&amp;G has grown by double digits in the past years and recently diversified into new revenue streams and has a market cap of only $380 million we highly think that the stock is undervalued.

**Stellantis NV (4.23%)**

Stellantis is the parent company of various auto brands such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia and Maserati. As the stock is not listed in the USA, the company only reports semiannually. The stock has dropped 35% from their high in 2022 due to recession fears and the broader market decline. Although the recession fear may be correct, it seems that Stellantis is punished before it has even committed a crime. With $50 billion in cash holdings and a market cap of $45 billion, the stock holds more cash per share than the current market price. The company has furthermore fully accelerated their EV strategy and has a broad diversified group of global customers. In the short term their earnings may of course deteriorate due to a recession but with an EV/EBITDA of 0.97 and cash flow yield of 48% it looks like the company is currently priced for a potential bankruptcy instead of a recession.

**Hewlett Packard (3.66%)**

Hewlett Packard (HP) is a technology company that offers a range of products and services, including personal computers, printers, software, and hardware. The company was founded in 1939 and has become a global leader in the technology industry. In recent years, the company has faced challenges as the technology industry has evolved and has undergone several major restructuring efforts to adapt to changing market conditions. HP has a strong free cash flow yield of 14% and has returned significant capital to shareholders. The company has returned $4 billion towards shareholders by share buybacks in 2022 and have thereby elevating earnings per share by 33% since 2018. The company furthermore carries a 3.88% dividend yield and has a highly shareholder friendly management that can run the business. HP has furthermore invested into more diverse revenue streams such as their recent acquisition of Poly. Approximately 75% of office workers are investing to improve their home setups. Traditional office spaces are also being reconfigured to support hybrid work and collaboration, with a focus on meeting room solutions. Currently, there are more than 90 million rooms, of which less than 10% have video capability. As a result, the office meeting room solutions segment is expected to triple by 2024 and HP is certain to profit from this transition.

**Paramount Global (2.41%)**

Paramount Global shares have dropped by 45.76% YTD. The company’s depressed value is due to a highly negative light on the global media outlook and DTC (direct to consumer) businesses. At a PE ratio of 3.85 and a dividend yield of 5.72%, we have time to wait out the storm surrounding media companies. The company is now priced to cheap to ignore any longer. Their streaming service Paramount+,  global revenue grew 95% YoY and they have added 4.6 million subscribers in the past quarter alone. They will launch Paramount+ in France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland in Q4 adding further to their subscriber amount and Paramount+ growing revenue. Total DTC revenue grew 38% YoY. In their theatrical unit: Top Gun: Maverick became the #1 best-selling digital sell-through title in the U.S. in its first week of release. The company continued to execute their differentiated strategy with strong IP assets (some of the studio's most famous iconic films include Titanic, Forrest Gump, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, and Mission: Impossible) which they can all use for generating additional revenue. The company furthermore continues to pay down debt aggressively. In businesses, it can take some time before the growth strategy eventually shows up in the company’s financials, reaching consumers and building various new revenue streams but this brings opportunities towards early observant investors.

1672454423,4,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market on this final trading week of 2022, and are ready for the new trading year ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 2nd, 2023.

# **Stocks fall to end Wall Street’s worst year since 2008, S&amp;P 500 finishes 2022 down nearly 20% - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks slipped on Friday to end a brutal 2022 with a whimper, as Wall Street wrapped up its worst year since 2008 on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 73.55 points, or 0.22%, to close at 33,147.25. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.25% to end at 3,839.50. The Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.11% to 10,466.88.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of trading in what has been a painful year for stocks. All three of the major averages suffered their worst year since 2008 and snapped a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down about 8.8%. The S&amp;P 500 sank 19.4%, and is more than 20% below its record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 33.1%.
*****
&gt; Sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks and weighed on investor sentiment throughout the year. Geopolitical concerns and volatile economic data also kept markets on edge.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had everything from Covid problems in China to the invasion of Ukraine. They’ve all been very serious. But for investors, it is what the Fed is doing,” said Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, on CNBC’s “The Exchange.”
*****
&gt; As the calendar turns to a new year, some investors think the pain is far from over. They expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows before rebounding in the second half of 2023.
*****
&gt; “I would love to tell you that it is going to be like the ‘Wizard of Oz’ and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter, and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that,” Cashin said.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 did break three-quarter losing streaks in the final three months of the year. The Nasdaq, however, dominated by the likes of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft, muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December, however.
*****
&gt; Communication services was the worst performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 this year, falling more than 40%, followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise, climbing 59%.

&gt; # One Year's Loss Is Not the Next Year's Gain

&gt; It's finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes, especially equities. As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the index's history, there have only been nine other years in which the S&amp;P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course, turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away, and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean we're due for a big gain the next year.

&gt; In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the S&amp;P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for next-year performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the S&amp;P fell 15%+, five times the index posted gains the next year, while four times the index posted further declines.

&gt; # Let’s Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row

&gt; As bad as 2022 has been for investors, there is a silver lining: back-to-back declines in the S&amp;P 500 are rarer than you may think.

&gt; If you go all the way back to 1950, the only times that stocks fell in back-to-back years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately, we don’t see similar scenarios within the current environment, so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-193.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look into the data, we found:

&gt; * The year after, a negative return saw the S&amp;P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time.
&gt; * A 10% (or greater) loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time.
&gt; * Out of the 20 negative years, only three times did returns get worse the following year (in 1974, 2001, and 2002).
&gt; * However, the following year, significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average (in 1975, 2003, and 2009).
&gt; * Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year, the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time.

&gt; # What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?

&gt; “It’s not what you look at that matters; it’s what you see.” Henry David Thoreau

&gt; I’ve done this for more than two decades, and I have to say, the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks, while the second half of the year should be better. But let’s be clear, overall, the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors (as we explained here).

&gt; The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously, it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012, and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013, and the economy did just fine.

&gt; You see, the stock market is always pricing things in, and if everyone is talking about it, you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said, “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.” We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors, and the general consensus is that next year will be bad, also. So the question is, how are we supposed to respond to this?

&gt; What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet, we have inflation coming down very quickly, an economy (while notably slowing, for sure) that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession (in part, thanks to a very strong consumer), and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar.

&gt; That’s right, the first quarter in a pre-election year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh, it was also up 7.4% on average (the very best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle). On top of that, the second quarter has also performed quite well, too. So, we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here, and I sure don’t hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/spx-quarterly-returns.png))**

&gt; Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me, I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else, but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.

&gt; # 2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment

&gt; As we noted in an earlier post, today's release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment, solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been.

&gt; For starters, the bull-bear spread heavily favors bears, and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below, the spread has been negative (meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish) for a record 39 weeks in a row- over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Across all weeks in 2022, bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987, that is a record low. In fact, the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2%, surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009, only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-1.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted in an earlier tweet, given the low readings on bullish sentiment, there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish, a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing above-average bullish sentiment, nearly every week this year (51) has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31%, tying the record high set in 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-3.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading, it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks (30) with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year, 1988 (one year after the survey began) was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words, this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally, there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average, that ties 2008 for the record high.

&gt; # Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year

&gt; Last-minute tax-loss selling, old sayings such as “year ends make great exits,” a desire to start with a clean slate, who knows exactly the answer, but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twenty-two years. Since 2000, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year, NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twenty-two years after having been up twenty-nine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twenty-two years. Russell 2000’s record very closely resembles NASDAQ, gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since.

&gt; # Country ETFs in 2022

&gt; Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below, we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries.

&gt; With 2022 drawing to a close, there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil (EWZ) and Mexico (EWW). Neither are up much, but up is up, especially in a year like this one.

&gt; In terms of month-to-date change, Hong Kong (EWH) has risen the most with a 5.62% gain, while China (MCHI) is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum, Taiwan (EWT) has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline, but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share long-term capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month.

&gt; # Pre-Election Year Januarys Stellar - #1 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, #2 DJIA

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but sixth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-consecutive-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twenty-three Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010, 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid-19 spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022, surging inflation, reaching multi-decade highs, stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January.

&gt; However, in pre-election years, Januarys have been outright stellar ranking #1 for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have only declined twice in pre-election Januarys, 2015 and 2003.

&gt; # Falling FAANG+

&gt; Yesterday Amazon (AMZN) became the third of the mega-cap FAANG+ stocks (along with META and NFLX) to close below its closing low made during the COVID Crash in March 2020. Not only have all of AMZN's post-pandemic gains been erased, but it's now trading below its lowest close made during the COVID Crash!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/amznchart.png))**

&gt; NYSE's FAANG+ index is described as an index of ""10 of today's highly-traded tech giants."" Given that most of the FAANG+ stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500, they are an impactful group. As shown below, the FAANG+ index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past November's low. On a relative basis, the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122822-FAANG-1.png))**

&gt; Below is a look at the ten FAANG+ stocks. As shown, they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion, and they're ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple (AAPL) has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change, it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has seen its market cap fall the second-most at $843 billion, essentially getting cut in half. Tesla (TSLA), along with AMZN, is one of two names that lost their ""$1 trillion market cap"" club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year, and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG+ stocks that are down 50%+ on the year include Meta (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Netflix (NFLX), AMD, and Snowflake (SNOW).

&gt; With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December, on an absolute basis, 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008, the Russell 3,000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today, the Russell 3,000's market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG+ stocks shown below.
