1655713880,3,"re-posting from what I posted a while back. TLDR. Roku is a dog. I would not be buying unless you believe it will be acquired by Netflix(or other large tech)

I would not be buying Roku. At all. I would be shorting the shit out of it. To understand why let me provide some background

**History**


Roku started out with dongles around 10 years ago. This was a super cool since it turned any dumb TV into a Smart TV. This got people talking. Roku grew in popularity and gained significant market share while spending fuck all on marketing. From their 2018 10k

“The Company incurred advertising costs of $3.4 million, $3.9 million and $4.1 million for the years December 31, 2017, 2016 and December 26, 2015 respectively.”


Roku gained market share by being in the right place at the right time and not having to worry about the big boys playing in their space. Once the dongle phase died out and all TVs were smart, Roku needed to be embedded in an OEM. Roku partnered with TCL (at the time a random Chinese company with no brand equity). Roku needed TCLs hardware capabilities and TCL needed Rokus goodwill with Americans and retail distribution channels.

With the absence of any serious threat, they switched from selling dongles to partnering with TCL and selling ad space on their OS. This drove up their ARPU to something absurd. From ~$10 in 2016 to $40+ today. Sounds amazing right? The problem is this caught the eyes of Google and Amazon.

**1 Why Roku is boned - The landscape**

As people moved away from linear TV, so active users and so did the advertising $$$. This caught the attention of the big boys – AMZN &amp; GOOG. More active users means more $$$ and the big boys want a slice of that pie. But it’s not all about $$$, the TV OS space just happens to play into both of their broader strategies around smart home integration and controlling the living room. Because of these $$$ on the table and the alignment to broader strategy, AMZN and GOOG decided to go HARD in this space. Both of them have now established partnerships with huge OEMs like Google – Sony, leaving Roku limited OEMs to partner with and still limited to the low end of the market. This has begun to slow down their growth and they have, for the first time, began loosing market share in the US.

 But why can’t Roku just partner with Samsung or LG who are the top players in mid to high end? Because TV OSes now generate fuck you $$. Samsung and LG already missed the boat with mobile. They are not willing to cede all that sweet sweet advertising $$$. Not only is Roku up against Google and Amazon, who have deep pockets and have just started to take this space seriously ( see Android TV’s rebrand to Google), you are up against the best TV manufactures in the world (LG and Samsung)

**2 Why Roku is boned – Active users is slowing and no room to grow**

AU is capping out in the US. There are very few dumb TV’s left to convert to smart TV’s and those purchasing smart TV’s have a huge range of different OS’s to choose from at all levels. So how is Roku going to get more users? Why not just go to Europe or Asia? The problem is, Roku has been saying that for years. Let’s take a look at their historical 10Ks Year ending 2017 “Further, we believe international expansion represents a large opportunity to grow our active accounts. We plan to continue to invest in our international strategy over time and become a global business in the long term.”

Roku has been saying this every year for the last 5 years. However they have completely failed internationally. They have &lt;5% market share internationally and have lost everything to Amazon and Google and the Koreans.

“While Roku captured a significant share of global viewing time, this prominence was primarily driven by North America, where it commanded 37% of big-screen viewing time in Q1 2021,” Conviva’s report stated. “In the second largest market for Roku, Europe, the company only accounted for 8% share of the big screen, trailing a number of other devices, including Samsung with 19%, Chromecast with 12%, Amazon Fire TV with 10%, LG TV with 10%, and Android TV with 9%.

""Roku’s position is even worse in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South Africa, all of which it has 4% usage or less, Conviva added. “ Given that Roku can’t reproduce it’s stick growth strategy that led to its massive growth early on. Do you really think that Roku can take back market share from Google, Amazon &amp; Samsung in global markets? Absolutely not
Once active users declines (which is only a matter of time given the aggression from everyone else), ad spend will follow and Roku’s growth trajectory is done

Roku has made a last ditch attempt at for survival with it's latest campaign ""OK, Roku does that"". This is it's first every campaign and drove up advertising costs 4x.

**3 Why Roku is boned – Producing content is expensive**


Roku took a huge fuck you bet on the Roku Channel to drive up ARPU. More viewing time means more $$. The problem is, content is fucking expensive. Just look how much Netflix has blown on content to produce (at best) completely mediocre shows. You can argue that the Roku TV is free so people aren’t paying for it. The problem with that is, at some point Netflix, Hulu, other streaming giants are going to have to offer an ad supported tier to keep their valuations up. Once Netflix does that, are people really going to watch free shit produced by Roku when they can watch free shit produced by Disney or Netflix (or any other of the 100 other services? Absolutely not. Roku is going to spend billions in a market to get boned by Netflix or Disney

**Conclusion**

Roku is fucked. Yes its history has been impressive but now it’s stuck between Tech Giants, Hardware Giants, and Streaming Giants who all want a piece of advertising $$$. I don’t see how Roku can compete since it’s missed the boat on international expansion and starting way behind on original content. The only hope for Roku is to get bought out by Apple (who also has done terribly in the TV OS space)  who also wants a slice of that pie. Apple has the money and Roku will be desperate in 1-2 years from now. Netflix is another potential option given their need for ad monestisation","re-posting I posted back. TLDR. Roku dog.

1656705259,2,"Let me explain in short why you should go with ASML over every other Semicon supplier. As an example I will take applied materials: 

Both companies manufacture Plants that are needed for for fabrication of chips.

If you want to fabricate a chip you have to buy from both companies. However Applied materials has more competitors for its technology, while ASML shares together with german company ZEISS (not publicy traded) a 10 year research lead for the technology needed to produce their systems. And there is no way the chinese could reverse engineer their lithography systems as they are so complex. 

So after all you should go with ASML simce they have the ultimate pricing power in their market sector.

Apple is cash heavy and will not be effected by any of it.  Their last earnings put them on track for a trillion dollar year.  They are one of the only west brands to succeed in breaking into China as a market.  

Disney and Delta.  In case you don’t know, travel is at an all time high.  These profits are not reflected in both of these companies right now.  Disney parks are running at capacity as if it’s Christmas all year round.  Delta can’t keep up with demand.

DraftKings is my bit of gambling.  They have successfully passed sports betting in 10 or more states.  They wrote a ballot measure in California that is weirdly specific to ice out most competition.

If the voters in California pass this bill, and I really think that they will, DraftKings may become the largest casino in the world.

And most importantly, your fear is artificially driving the costs down making it a perfect day for a discount shopping day.","I don’t believe real estate bubble all. Inventory tight.

Just because he made one joke about shorts that doesn't mean he was ""pumping the stock"". He tweeted multiple times about this fact before the market started listening and realised it was just Hertz trying to get publicity for nothing special.

But I wouldn't invest in Zoom simply because it's a one trick pony, there's no technological moat/advantage that Zoom has - if Teams can solve these issues, then companies will happily accept Teams as it's bundled in with Office anyway.","Companies use Teams bundled Microsoft Office - Teams far inferior product Zoom, I clients use Zoom I get organise meetings using Zoom use full functionality like annotations - annotate Teams, everyone network/office - external invitees (which meetings involve) lose functionality Teams, Zoom!
